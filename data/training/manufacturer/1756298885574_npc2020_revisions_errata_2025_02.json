This may\ninvolve the adoption of the NPC without change or with modifications to suit local needs,\nand the enactment of other laws and regulations regarding plumbing system design and\ninstallation, including requirements for professional involvement.\nThe NPC is a model code in the sense that it helps promote consistency among provincial\nand territorial plumbing codes. Persons involved in th\ne design or installation of plumbing\nsystems should consult the provincial or territorial jurisdiction concerned to find out which\nplumbing code is applicable.\nThis edition of the NPC succeeds the 2015 edition.\nDevelopment of the National Model Codes\nGOVERNANCE CHANGE NOTE: The national code development system underwent a\ngovernance change in November 2022 to support efforts to harmonize construction codes\nin jurisdictions throughout Canada. The CCBFC, which had been in place since 1991, was\ndissolved and replaced by a new governance model in which the Canadian Board for\nHarmonized Construction Codes (CBHCC) is responsible for developing, approving and\nmaintaining the National Model Codes based on the strategic priorities set by the Canadian\nTable for Harmonized Construction Codes Policy. The 2020 National Model Codes were\ndeveloped by the CCBFC. In this section, references to the CCBFC are written in the past\ntense to reflect the change in governance.\nThe CCBFC, an independent committee established by the National Research Council of\nCanada (NRC), was responsible for the content of the 2020 editions of the National Model\nCodes. The CCBFC was made up of volunteers from across the country and from all facets of\nthe Codes-user community. Members of the CCBFC and its standing committees included\nbuilders, engineers, skilled trade workers, architects, building owners, building operators, fire\nand building officials, manufacturers, and representatives of general interests.\nThe CCBFC was advised on scope, policy and technical issues pertaining to the Codes by\nthe Provincial/Territorial Policy Advisory Committee on Codes (PTPACC), which was a\ncommittee of senior representatives from provincial/territorial ministries responsible for\nbuilding, fire, plumbing, and energy regulation in their jurisdictions. The PTPACC was\ncreated by the provinces and territories, with provision of guidance to the CCBFC as one of its\nmain functions. Through the PTPACC, the provinces and territories were engaged in every\nphase of the Codes development process.\nCodes Canada staff within the Construction Research Centre at the NRC provided technical\nand administrative support to the CCBFC and its standing committees, and coordinated the\nprovision of evidence-based research to inform Codes development. The NRC publishes the\nNational Model Codes and periodic revisions to the Codes to address pressing issues.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020v\n\nPreface\nThe broader Codes-user community makes significant contributions to the Codes\ndevelopment process by submitting requests for changes or additions to the Codes and by\ncommenting on the proposed changes during the public reviews that precede each new\nedition.\nThe CCBFC took into consideration the advice received from the provinces and territories as\nwell as Codes users' comments at each stage of Codes development. The scope and content of\nthe National Model Codes are determined on a consensus basis, which involves the review of\ntechnical, policy and practical concerns and discussion of the implications of these concerns.\nMore information on the Codes development process is available on the CBHCC's website.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nThe NPC sets out technical provisions for the design and installation of new plumbing\nsystems. It also applies to the extension, alteration, renewal and repair of existing plumbing\nsystems.\nThe NPC establishes requirements to address the following four objectives:\n•safety\n• health\n• protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage\n• environment\nCode provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings and facilities\nthat might be considered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive\nconsensus process used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see the section\nentitled Development of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided\nwhich characteristics should be regulated through the NPC.\nThe provisions of the NPC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required\nto adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they\nare adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become\nminimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required\nto achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority.\nThe NPC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory, becomes\na regulation. It is not a guideline on plumbing system design or installation. The design of a\ntechnically sound plumbing system depends upon many factors beyond compliance with\nplumbing regulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners\nwho have received appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar\nwith the principles of good plumbing practice and experience using reference manuals and\ntechnical guides.\nThe NPC does not list acceptable proprietary plumbing products. It establishes the criteria\nthat plumbing materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are\nexplicitly stated in the NPC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product\nstandards published by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the\nstandards related to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NPC.\nCode Requirements\nMost NPC requirements address at least one ofthe Code's four stated objectives (safety,\nhealth, protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage, and\nenvironment).\nIn processing proposed changes or additions to any of the National Model Codes, many\nissues are considered, such as the following:\n• Does the proposed requirement provide the minimum level of performance—and\nno more than the minimum—needed to achieve the Code's objectives?\nviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\nPreface\n• Will persons responsible for Code compliance be able to act on or implement the\nrequirement using commonly accepted practices?\n• Will enforcement agencies be able to enforce the requirement?\n• Are the costs of implementing the requirement justifiable?\n• Have the potential policy implications of the requirement been identified and\naddressed?\n• Is there broad consensus on this requirement among Code users representing all\nfacets of the plumbing system design and construction industries, as well as among\nprovincial and territorial governments?\nGuidel\nines for requesting changes to the NPC are available on the CBHCC's website.\nObjective-Based Code Format\nThe NPC has been published in an objective-based code format since 2005.\nAs described in more detail in the section entitled Structure of the NPC, the Code comprises\nthree Divisions:\n• Division A, which defines the scope of the Code and contains the objectives, the\nfunctional statements and the conditions necessary to achieve compliance;\n• Division B, which contains acceptable solutions (commonly referred to as “technical\nrequirements”) deemed to satisfy the objectives and functional statements listed in\nDivision A; and\n• Division C, which contains administrative provisions.\nMostoftherequirementsinDivisionBarelinkedtothreetypesofinformation:\n• objectives (Code objectives, such as safety or health, which individual requirements\nhelp to address),\n• functional statements (statements of the functions of the plumbing system that a\nparticular requirement helps to achieve), and\n• intent statements (detailed statements of the specific intent of the requirement).\nObjectives\nThe NPC's objectives are fully defined in Section 2.2. of Division A.\nThe objectives describe, in broad terms, the overall goals that the NPC's requirements are\nintended to achieve. They serve to define the boundaries of the subject areas the Code\naddresses. However, the Code does not address all the issues that might be considered\nto fall within those boundaries.\nThe objectives describe undesirable situations and their consequences, which the Code\naims to prevent from occurring in plumbing systems. The wording of most of the\ndefinitions of the objectives includes two key phrases: “limit the probability” and\n“unacceptable risk.” The phrase “limit the probability” is used to acknowledge that the\nNPC cannot entirely prevent those undesirable situations from happening. The phrase\n“unacceptable risk” acknowledges that the NPC cannot eliminate all risk: the “acceptable\nrisk” is the risk remaining once compliance with the Code has been achieved.\nThe objectives are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be used on their own in the\ndesign and approval processes.\nThe objectives attributed to the requirements or portions of requirements in Division B\narelistedinatableinSection2.8.ofDivisionB.\nFunctional Statements\nThe NPC's functional statements are defined in Section 3.2. of Division A.\nThe functional statements are more detailed than the objectives. They describe conditions\nin the plumbing system that help satisfy the objectives.

Persons\ninterested in requesting a change to an NPC provision should refer to the guidelines available\non the CHBCC's website.\nTo submit comments or suggestions, please contact:\nThe Secretary\nCanadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes\n1200 Montreal Road\nOttawa, Ontario K1A 0R6\nE-mail: CBHCCSecretary-SecretaireCCHCC@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xi\n\nRelationship of the NPC to Standards\nDevelopment and Conformity\nAssessment\nThe development of many provisions in the NPC and the assessment of conformity to those\nprovisions are supported by several of the member organizations of Canada's National\nStandards System (NSS).\nThe NSS is a network of accredited organizations concerned with standards development,\ncertification, testing and inspection that is established under the auspices of the Standards\nCouncil of Canada Act. Activities of the NSS are coordinated by the Standards Council of\nCanada (SCC), which accredits standards development organizations, certification bodies,\ntesting and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, among others.\nThe SCC is a non-profit federal Crown corporation responsible for the coordination of\nvoluntary standardization in Canada. It also coordinates Canadian participation in voluntary\ninternational standardization activities.\nCanadian Standards\nMany of the standards referenced in the NPC are published by standards development\norganizations accredited in Canada. As part of the accreditation requirements, these\norganizations adhere to the principle of consensus, which generally means substantial\nmajority agreement of a committee comprising a balance of producer, user and general\ninterest members, and the consideration of all negative comments. The standards\ndevelopment organizations also have formal procedures for the balloting and second-level\nreview of standards prepared under their oversight.\nThe following organizations are accredited as standards development organizations in\nCanada:\n• Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI)\n• ASTM International\n• Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ)\n• Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB)\n•CSAGroup\n• International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO)\n•ULCStandards\n• Underwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL)\nTable 1.3.1.2. of Division B lists the standards referenced in the NPC. Standards proposed to\nbe referenced in the NPC are reviewed to ensure that their content is compatible with the\nCode. Thereafter, referenced standards are reviewed as needed during each Code cycle.\nStandards development organizations are asked to provide information on any changes in the\nstatus of their standards referenced in the NPC—withdrawals, amendments, new editions,\netc. This information is passed on to the CBHCC, its code development committees, and\ninterested stakeholders, all of whom are given the opportunity to identify any problems\nassociated with the changes. These bodies do not necessarily review in detail the revised\nstandards; rather, the approach relies on the consensus process involved in the maintenance\nof the standards and on the extensive knowledge and experience of committee members,\nprovincial or territorial staff, NRC staff, and consulted stakeholders to identify changes in the\nstandards that might create problems in the Code.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xiii\n\nRevisions and Errata\nIssued by the Canadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes\nThe Change Summary table that follows describes revisions, errata and editorial modifications\nthat apply to the National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020:\n• Revisions are changes that have been approved by the Canadian Board for Harmonized\nConstruction Codes for publication between Code editions.\n• Errata are corrections to existing text.\n• Editorial updates are provided for information purposes only.\n• Editorial changes are modifications that improve clarity.\nCode pages containing revisions and/or errata are identified with the words “Amended Page”\nin the footer; pages with editorial modifications and index pages with changes are not flagged.\nCode users should contact their local authority having jurisdiction to find out if these\nrevisions and errata apply in their province or territory.\nChange Summary (Date: 2025-02) — National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nDivisi\non\nCode ReferenceChangeDescription of Change\nPreface\nn/a\neditorial\nupdate\nPreface was updated to reflect change in governance of national code development system\nList of defined terms was corrected as follows:\nCare*: term and definition were added\nCare oc\ncupancy*: term and definition were added\nCare or detention occupancy: term and definition were deleted\nDetention occupancy*: term and definition were added\n1.4.1.2.(1)\nerrata\n(unless\notherwise\nindicated)\nHome-\ntype care occupancy*: term and definition were added\neditorial\nchang\ne\nNominal pipe size (NPS): definition was revised to read “... nominal diameter in inches by\nwhic\nhthesizeofapipe,...”\nTreatment*: term and definition were added\nTreatment occupancy*: term and definition were added\nNote was corrected as follows:\nSection titled “Care Occupancy” was added\nSection titled “Home-Type Care Occupancy” was added\nSection titled “Treatment” was added\nA\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nerrata\nSection titled “Treatment Occupancy” was added\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xix\n\nPreface\nChange Summary (Date: 2025-02) — National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020 (Continued)\nDivision\nCode ReferenceChangeDescription of Change\n1.3.1.1.(1)\nrevision\nDate stated in Sentence was revised to read “15 July 2022”\nTable 1.3.1.2.revision\nDocument references were updated as applicable to reflect more recent editions published\nas of 15 July\n2022\n1.3.2.1.\neditorial\nupdate\nList of abbreviations was updated to include “CBHCC”\n2.4.4.3.(1)\nerratum\nSentence was corrected to read “... or in acare,treatmentordetention occupancy, ...”\nArticle was corrected as follows:\nSentences were reordered and revised for clarity\nSentence (2) was added\n2.4.6.4.\nerrata\nSentence (3) was corrected to read “Except as provided in Sentences (4) and (5), ...”\nTable 2.8.1.1.\nerratu\nm\nArticle 2.4.6.4.: entry was added as follows: “(2) [F81-OH2.1]”\nB\nFigure A-2.5.3.1.-E\nerratum\nFigure was corrected by moving “This stack may act as the relief vent ...” from Example 2\nto Exa\nmple 1\nC\nA-2.3.1.editorial\nupdat\ne\nLast paragraph of Note was updated to read “... on the CBHCC's website.”\nLetter C\nerratum\n“Care or detention occupancy” was corrected to read “Care, treatment or detention\noccu\npancy”\nLetter D\nerratum\n“Detention occupancy”: entry was added\nLetter H\nerratum\n“Home-type care occupancy”: entry was added\nIndex\nLetter T\nerratum\n“Treatment occupancy”: entry was added\nxxNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\n1.4.1.2.Division A\nBuilding trapmeans atrapthat is installed in abuilding drainorbuilding sewerto\nprevent the circulation of air between adrainage systemand a public sewer.

They are published as a separate electronic document entitled\n“Supplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is available on the NRC's website.\nAreas of Performance\nA subset of the acceptable solutions in Division B may establish criteria for particular types of designs (e.g.,\ncertain types of materials, components, assemblies, or systems). Often such subsets of acceptable solutions\nare all attributed to the same objective: OH2, Sanitation, for example. In some cases, the designs that are\nnormally used to satisfy this subset of acceptable solutions might also provide some benefits that could be\nrelated to some other objective: OP5, Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage,\nfor example. However, if none of the applicable acceptable solutions are linked to Objective OP5, it is not\nnecessary that alternative solutions proposed to replace these acceptable solutions provide a similar benefit\nrelated to Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage. In other words, the\nacceptable solutions in Division B establish acceptable levels of performance for compliance with the Code\nonly in those areas defined by the objectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solutions.\nApplicable Acceptable Solutions\nIn demonstrating that an alternative solution will perform as well as a design that would satisfy the\napplicable acceptable solutions in Division B, its evaluation should not be limited to comparison with the\nacceptable solutions to which an alternative is proposed. It is possible that acceptable solutions elsewhere\nin the Code also apply. The proposed alternative solution may be shown to perform as well as the most\napparent acceptable solution, which it is replacing, but may not perform as well as other relevant acceptable\nsolutions. For example, an innovative piping material may perform adequately in a drainage system, but\nmay not meet combustibility requirements elsewhere in the Code. All applicable acceptable solutions\nshould be taken into consideration in demonstrating the compliance of an alternative solution.\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)  Defined Terms.\nAuxiliary Water Supply\nThe auxiliary water supply may include water from a secondary potable water supply or from any natural\nsource, such as a well, lake, spring, stream or harbour. It may also include waste water (but not sanitary\ndrainage) from industrial processes, such as cooling towers, or from storm retention ponds. These sources\nmay be polluted or contaminated and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the primary\nwater purveyor does not have sanitary control. It is generally accepted that there are two categories of\nauxiliary water supply:\n(a) any public potable water supply over which the primary water purveyor does not have sanitary\ncontrol, or\n(b) any private water supply, other than the primary potable water supply, that is on or available to the\npremises.\nCare Occupancy\nSupport services rendered by or through care facility management refer to services provided by the\norganization that is responsible for the care for a period exceeding 24 consecutive hours. They do not refer\nto services provided by residents of dwelling units or suites, or to services arranged directly by residents\nof dwelling units or suites with outside agencies.\nIn the context of care occupancies, these services may include a daily assessment of the resident's\nfunctioning, awareness of their whereabouts, the making of appointments for residents and reminding\nthem of those appointments, the ability and readiness to intervene if a crisis arises for a resident,\nsupervision in areas of nutrition or medication, and provision of transient medical services. Services\nmay also include activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and assistance in the use of\nwashroom facilities, etc. No actual treatment is provided by or through care facility management.\nClass 3 Fire Sprinkler/Standpipe Systems\nIn Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems, water is supplied to the storage facilities from the public water\nsupply and is maintained in potable condition. Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems resemble Class 1\nfire sprinkler/standpipe systems in all other respects.\n1-12  Division AAmended PageNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\nDivision AA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nClear-Water Waste\nExamples of clear-water waste are the waste waters discharged from a drinking fountain, cooling jacket, air\nconditioner or relief valve outlet.\nEmergency Floor Drains\nThere are two types of floor drains. One is an emergency floor drain installed to avoid flooding in a\nbuilding from any pipe or fixture failure. The other encompasses floor drains installed to receive discharge\nfrom specific pieces of equipment; this type is defined as a fixture.\nHome-Type Care Occupancy\nSupport services rendered to the residents of a home-type care occupancy refer to services provided at\na cost by caregivers who are responsible for the care for a period exceeding 24 consecutive hours. They\ndo not refer to services provided by family members of the residents, or to services arranged directly by\nresidents with outside agencies.\nIn the context of home-type care occupancies, these services may include a daily assessment of the\nresident's functioning, awareness of their whereabouts, the making of appointments for residents and\nreminding them of those appointments, the ability and readiness to intervene if a crisis arises for a resident,\nsupervision in areas of nutrition or medication, and provision of transient medical services. Services\nmay also include activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and assistance in the use of\nwashroom facilities, etc. No actual treatment is provided by the caregivers.\nTreatment\nThe ability to evacuate unassisted implies that a person is capable of recognizing and responding to an\nemergency given their physical, cognitive and behavioural abilities, and able to move to a safe location\nwithout the assistance of another person. For example, such persons must be able to arise and walk, or\ntransfer from a bed or chair to a means of mobility, and leave the building or move to a safe location on\ntheir own.\nTreatment Occupancy\n“Treatments” may include such things as surgery, intensive care, and emergency medical intervention.\nTreatment services differ from the services provided by care occupancies like personal care assistance or the\nadministration of medication, and from those provided by business and personal services occupancies like\ndentistry or day procedures.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Amended PageDivision A  1-13\n\n1.2.2.1.Division B\n1.2.2.Symbols and Other Abbreviations\n1.2.2.1.Symbols and Other Abbreviations\n1)ThesymbolsandotherabbreviationsinDivisionBshallhavethemeanings\nassigned to them in Article 1.4.2.1. of Division A and Article 1.3.2.1.\nSection 1.3.

Documentation of Alternative Solutions.Beyond the purposes of demonstrating\ncompliance and acquiring an installation permit, there are other important reasons for requiring that the\nproponent of an alternative solution submit project documentation (i.e. a compliance report) to the authority\nhaving jurisdiction and for the authority having jurisdiction to retain that documentation for a substantial\nperiod following the installation of a plumbing system:\n• Most jurisdictions require that a plumbing system be maintained in compliance with the codes under\nwhich it was installed. Alternative solutions made possible by objective-based codes may have special\nmaintenance requirements, which would be described in the documentation.\n• Documentation helps consultants perform code compliance assessments of existing buildings or facilities\nbefore they are sold and informs current owners or prospective buyers of existing buildings or facilities of\nany limitations pertaining to their future use or development.\n• Documentation provides design professionals with the basic information necessary to design changes to\nan existing plumbing system.\n• An alternative solution could be invalidated by aproposed alteration to a plumbing system. Designers\nand regulators must therefore know the details of the particular alternative solutions that were integral to\nthe original design. Complete documentation should provide insight as to why one alternative solution\nwas chosen over another.\n• Documentation is the “paper trail” of the alternative solution negotiated between the designer and the\nregulator and should demonstrate that a rational process led to the acceptance of the alternative solution\nas an equivalency.\n• It is possible that over time a particular alternative solution may be shown to be inadequate. It would be\nadvantageous for a jurisdiction to know which plumbing systems included that alternative solution as\npart of their design: documentation will facilitate this type of analysis.\n• Project documentation provides important information to a forensic team that is called to investigate an\naccident or why a design failed to provide the level of performance expected.\nThis subject is discussed in further detail in “Recommended Documentation Requirements for Projects Using\nAlternative Solutions in the Context of Objective-Based Codes,” which was prepared for the CCBFC Task\nGroup on Implementation of Objective-Based Codes and is available on the CBHCC's website.\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements.

      "content": "The NPC is a model code in the sense that it helps promote consistency among provincial\nand territorial plumbing codes. Persons involved in th\ne design or installation of plumbing\nsystems should consult the provincial or territorial jurisdiction concerned to find out which\nplumbing code is applicable.\nThis edition of the NPC succeeds the 2015 edition.\nDevelopment of the National Model Codes\nGOVERNANCE CHANGE NOTE: The national code development system underwent a\ngovernance change in November 2022 to support efforts to harmonize construction codes\nin jurisdictions throughout Canada. The CCBFC, which had been in place since 1991, was\ndissolved and replaced by a new governance model in which the Canadian Board for\nHarmonized Construction Codes (CBHCC) is responsible for developing, approving and\nmaintaining the National Model Codes based on the strategic priorities set by the Canadian\nTable for Harmonized Construction Codes Policy. The 2020 National Model Codes were\ndeveloped by the CCBFC. In this section, references to the CCBFC are written in the past\ntense to reflect the change in governance.\nThe CCBFC, an independent committee established by the National Research Council of\nCanada (NRC), was responsible for the content of the 2020 editions of the National Model\nCodes. The CCBFC was made up of volunteers from across the country and from all facets of\nthe Codes-user community. Members of the CCBFC and its standing committees included\nbuilders, engineers, skilled trade workers, architects, building owners, building operators, fire\nand building officials, manufacturers, and representatives of general interests.\nThe CCBFC was advised on scope, policy and technical issues pertaining to the Codes by\nthe Provincial/Territorial Policy Advisory Committee on Codes (PTPACC), which was a\ncommittee of senior representatives from provincial/territorial ministries responsible for\nbuilding, fire, plumbing, and energy regulation in their jurisdictions. The PTPACC was\ncreated by the provinces and territories, with provision of guidance to the CCBFC as one of its\nmain functions. Through the PTPACC, the provinces and territories were engaged in every\nphase of the Codes development process.\nCodes Canada staff within the Construction Research Centre at the NRC provided technical\nand administrative support to the CCBFC and its standing committees, and coordinated the\nprovision of evidence-based research to inform Codes development. The NRC publishes the\nNational Model Codes and periodic revisions to the Codes to address pressing issues.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020v\n\nPreface\nThe broader Codes-user community makes significant contributions to the Codes\ndevelopment process by submitting requests for changes or additions to the Codes and by\ncommenting on the proposed changes during the public reviews that precede each new\nedition.\nThe CCBFC took into consideration the advice received from the provinces and territories as\nwell as Codes users' comments at each stage of Codes development. The scope and content of\nthe National Model Codes are determined on a consensus basis, which involves the review of\ntechnical, policy and practical concerns and discussion of the implications of these concerns.\nMore information on the Codes development process is available on the CBHCC's website.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nThe NPC sets out technical provisions for the design and installation of new plumbing\nsystems. It also applies to the extension, alteration, renewal and repair of existing plumbing\nsystems.\nThe NPC establishes requirements to address the following four objectives:\n•safety\n• health\n• protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage\n• environment\nCode provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings and facilities\nthat might be considered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive\nconsensus process used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see the section\nentitled Development of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided\nwhich characteristics should be regulated through the NPC.\nThe provisions of the NPC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required\nto adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they\nare adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become\nminimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required\nto achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority.\nThe NPC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory, becomes\na regulation. It is not a guideline on plumbing system design or installation. The design of a\ntechnically sound plumbing system depends upon many factors beyond compliance with\nplumbing regulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners\nwho have received appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar\nwith the principles of good plumbing practice and experience using reference manuals and\ntechnical guides.\nThe NPC does not list acceptable proprietary plumbing products. It establishes the criteria\nthat plumbing materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are\nexplicitly stated in the NPC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product\nstandards published by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the\nstandards related to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NPC.\nCode Requirements\nMost NPC requirements address at least one ofthe Code's four stated objectives (safety,\nhealth, protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage, and\nenvironment).\nIn processing proposed changes or additions to any of the National Model Codes, many\nissues are considered, such as the following:\n• Does the proposed requirement provide the minimum level of performance—and\nno more than the minimum—needed to achieve the Code's objectives?\nviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\nPreface\n• Will persons responsible for Code compliance be able to act on or implement the\nrequirement using commonly accepted practices?\n• Will enforcement agencies be able to enforce the requirement?\n• Are the costs of implementing the requirement justifiable?\n• Have the potential policy implications of the requirement been identified and\naddressed?\n• Is there broad consensus on this requirement among Code users representing all\nfacets of the plumbing system design and construction industries, as well as among\nprovincial and territorial governments?\nGuidel\nines for requesting changes to the NPC are available on the CBHCC's website.\nObjective-Based Code Format\nThe NPC has been published in an objective-based code format since 2005.\nAs described in more detail in the section entitled Structure of the NPC, the Code comprises\nthree Divisions:\n• Division A, which defines the scope of the Code and contains the objectives, the\nfunctional statements and the conditions necessary to achieve compliance;\n• Division B, which contains acceptable solutions (commonly referred to as “technical\nrequirements”) deemed to satisfy the objectives and functional statements listed in\nDivision A; and\n• Division C, which contains administrative provisions.\nMostoftherequirementsinDivisionBarelinkedtothreetypesofinformation:\n• objectives (Code objectives, such as safety or health, which individual requirements\nhelp to address),\n• functional statements (statements of the functions of the plumbing system that a\nparticular requirement helps to achieve), and\n• intent statements (detailed statements of the specific intent of the requirement).\nObjectives\nThe NPC's objectives are fully defined in Section 2.2. of Division A.\nThe objectives describe, in broad terms, the overall goals that the NPC's requirements are\nintended to achieve. They serve to define the boundaries of the subject areas the Code\naddresses. However, the Code does not address all the issues that might be considered\nto fall within those boundaries.\nThe objectives describe undesirable situations and their consequences, which the Code\naims to prevent from occurring in plumbing systems. The wording of most of the\ndefinitions of the objectives includes two key phrases: “limit the probability” and\n“unacceptable risk.” The phrase “limit the probability” is used to acknowledge that the\nNPC cannot entirely prevent those undesirable situations from happening. The phrase\n“unacceptable risk” acknowledges that the NPC cannot eliminate all risk: the “acceptable\nrisk” is the risk remaining once compliance with the Code has been achieved.\nThe objectives are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be used on their own in the\ndesign and approval processes.\nThe objectives attributed to the requirements or portions of requirements in Division B\narelistedinatableinSection2.8.ofDivisionB.\nFunctional Statements\nThe NPC's functional statements are defined in Section 3.2. of Division A.\nThe functional statements are more detailed than the objectives. They describe conditions\nin the plumbing system that help satisfy the objectives.

Activities of the NSS are coordinated by the Standards Council of\nCanada (SCC), which accredits standards development organizations, certification bodies,\ntesting and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, among others.\nThe SCC is a non-profit federal Crown corporation responsible for the coordination of\nvoluntary standardization in Canada. It also coordinates Canadian participation in voluntary\ninternational standardization activities.\nCanadian Standards\nMany of the standards referenced in the NPC are published by standards development\norganizations accredited in Canada. As part of the accreditation requirements, these\norganizations adhere to the principle of consensus, which generally means substantial\nmajority agreement of a committee comprising a balance of producer, user and general\ninterest members, and the consideration of all negative comments. The standards\ndevelopment organizations also have formal procedures for the balloting and second-level\nreview of standards prepared under their oversight.\nThe following organizations are accredited as standards development organizations in\nCanada:\n• Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI)\n• ASTM International\n• Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ)\n• Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB)\n•CSAGroup\n• International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO)\n•ULCStandards\n• Underwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL)\nTable 1.3.1.2. of Division B lists the standards referenced in the NPC. Standards proposed to\nbe referenced in the NPC are reviewed to ensure that their content is compatible with the\nCode. Thereafter, referenced standards are reviewed as needed during each Code cycle.\nStandards development organizations are asked to provide information on any changes in the\nstatus of their standards referenced in the NPC—withdrawals, amendments, new editions,\netc. This information is passed on to the CBHCC, its code development committees, and\ninterested stakeholders, all of whom are given the opportunity to identify any problems\nassociated with the changes. These bodies do not necessarily review in detail the revised\nstandards; rather, the approach relies on the consensus process involved in the maintenance\nof the standards and on the extensive knowledge and experience of committee members,\nprovincial or territorial staff, NRC staff, and consulted stakeholders to identify changes in the\nstandards that might create problems in the Code.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xiii\n\nRevisions and Errata\nIssued by the Canadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes\nThe Change Summary table that follows describes revisions, errata and editorial modifications\nthat apply to the National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020:\n• Revisions are changes that have been approved by the Canadian Board for Harmonized\nConstruction Codes for publication between Code editions.\n• Errata are corrections to existing text.\n• Editorial updates are provided for information purposes only.\n• Editorial changes are modifications that improve clarity.\nCode pages containing revisions and/or errata are identified with the words “Amended Page”\nin the footer; pages with editorial modifications and index pages with changes are not flagged.\nCode users should contact their local authority having jurisdiction to find out if these\nrevisions and errata apply in their province or territory.\nChange Summary (Date: 2025-02) — National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nDivisi\non\nCode ReferenceChangeDescription of Change\nPreface\nn/a\neditorial\nupdate\nPreface was updated to reflect change in governance of national code development system\nList of defined terms was corrected as follows:\nCare*: term and definition were added\nCare oc\ncupancy*: term and definition were added\nCare or detention occupancy: term and definition were deleted\nDetention occupancy*: term and definition were added\n1.4.1.2.(1)\nerrata\n(unless\notherwise\nindicated)\nHome-\ntype care occupancy*: term and definition were added\neditorial\nchang\ne\nNominal pipe size (NPS): definition was revised to read “... nominal diameter in inches by\nwhic\nhthesizeofapipe,...”\nTreatment*: term and definition were added\nTreatment occupancy*: term and definition were added\nNote was corrected as follows:\nSection titled “Care Occupancy” was added\nSection titled “Home-Type Care Occupancy” was added\nSection titled “Treatment” was added\nA\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nerrata\nSection titled “Treatment Occupancy” was added\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xix\n\nPreface\nChange Summary (Date: 2025-02) — National Plumbing Code of Canada 2020 (Continued)\nDivision\nCode ReferenceChangeDescription of Change\n1.3.1.1.(1)\nrevision\nDate stated in Sentence was revised to read “15 July 2022”\nTable 1.3.1.2.revision\nDocument references were updated as applicable to reflect more recent editions published\nas of 15 July\n2022\n1.3.2.1.\neditorial\nupdate\nList of abbreviations was updated to include “CBHCC”\n2.4.4.3.(1)\nerratum\nSentence was corrected to read “... or in acare,treatmentordetention occupancy, ...”\nArticle was corrected as follows:\nSentences were reordered and revised for clarity\nSentence (2) was added\n2.4.6.4.\nerrata\nSentence (3) was corrected to read “Except as provided in Sentences (4) and (5), ...”\nTable 2.8.1.1.\nerratu\nm\nArticle 2.4.6.4.: entry was added as follows: “(2) [F81-OH2.1]”\nB\nFigure A-2.5.3.1.-E\nerratum\nFigure was corrected by moving “This stack may act as the relief vent ...” from Example 2\nto Exa\nmple 1\nC\nA-2.3.1.editorial\nupdat\ne\nLast paragraph of Note was updated to read “... on the CBHCC's website.”\nLetter C\nerratum\n“Care or detention occupancy” was corrected to read “Care, treatment or detention\noccu\npancy”\nLetter D\nerratum\n“Detention occupancy”: entry was added\nLetter H\nerratum\n“Home-type care occupancy”: entry was added\nIndex\nLetter T\nerratum\n“Treatment occupancy”: entry was added\nxxNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\n1.4.1.2.Division A\nBuilding trapmeans atrapthat is installed in abuilding drainorbuilding sewerto\nprevent the circulation of air between adrainage systemand a public sewer.

They are published as a separate electronic document entitled\n“Supplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is available on the NRC's website.\nAreas of Performance\nA subset of the acceptable solutions in Division B may establish criteria for particular types of designs (e.g.,\ncertain types of materials, components, assemblies, or systems). Often such subsets of acceptable solutions\nare all attributed to the same objective: OH2, Sanitation, for example. In some cases, the designs that are\nnormally used to satisfy this subset of acceptable solutions might also provide some benefits that could be\nrelated to some other objective: OP5, Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage,\nfor example. However, if none of the applicable acceptable solutions are linked to Objective OP5, it is not\nnecessary that alternative solutions proposed to replace these acceptable solutions provide a similar benefit\nrelated to Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage. In other words, the\nacceptable solutions in Division B establish acceptable levels of performance for compliance with the Code\nonly in those areas defined by the objectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solutions.\nApplicable Acceptable Solutions\nIn demonstrating that an alternative solution will perform as well as a design that would satisfy the\napplicable acceptable solutions in Division B, its evaluation should not be limited to comparison with the\nacceptable solutions to which an alternative is proposed. It is possible that acceptable solutions elsewhere\nin the Code also apply. The proposed alternative solution may be shown to perform as well as the most\napparent acceptable solution, which it is replacing, but may not perform as well as other relevant acceptable\nsolutions. For example, an innovative piping material may perform adequately in a drainage system, but\nmay not meet combustibility requirements elsewhere in the Code. All applicable acceptable solutions\nshould be taken into consideration in demonstrating the compliance of an alternative solution.\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)  Defined Terms.\nAuxiliary Water Supply\nThe auxiliary water supply may include water from a secondary potable water supply or from any natural\nsource, such as a well, lake, spring, stream or harbour. It may also include waste water (but not sanitary\ndrainage) from industrial processes, such as cooling towers, or from storm retention ponds. These sources\nmay be polluted or contaminated and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the primary\nwater purveyor does not have sanitary control. It is generally accepted that there are two categories of\nauxiliary water supply:\n(a) any public potable water supply over which the primary water purveyor does not have sanitary\ncontrol, or\n(b) any private water supply, other than the primary potable water supply, that is on or available to the\npremises.\nCare Occupancy\nSupport services rendered by or through care facility management refer to services provided by the\norganization that is responsible for the care for a period exceeding 24 consecutive hours. They do not refer\nto services provided by residents of dwelling units or suites, or to services arranged directly by residents\nof dwelling units or suites with outside agencies.\nIn the context of care occupancies, these services may include a daily assessment of the resident's\nfunctioning, awareness of their whereabouts, the making of appointments for residents and reminding\nthem of those appointments, the ability and readiness to intervene if a crisis arises for a resident,\nsupervision in areas of nutrition or medication, and provision of transient medical services. Services\nmay also include activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and assistance in the use of\nwashroom facilities, etc. No actual treatment is provided by or through care facility management.\nClass 3 Fire Sprinkler/Standpipe Systems\nIn Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems, water is supplied to the storage facilities from the public water\nsupply and is maintained in potable condition. Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems resemble Class 1\nfire sprinkler/standpipe systems in all other respects.\n1-12  Division AAmended PageNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n\nDivision AA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nClear-Water Waste\nExamples of clear-water waste are the waste waters discharged from a drinking fountain, cooling jacket, air\nconditioner or relief valve outlet.\nEmergency Floor Drains\nThere are two types of floor drains. One is an emergency floor drain installed to avoid flooding in a\nbuilding from any pipe or fixture failure. The other encompasses floor drains installed to receive discharge\nfrom specific pieces of equipment; this type is defined as a fixture.\nHome-Type Care Occupancy\nSupport services rendered to the residents of a home-type care occupancy refer to services provided at\na cost by caregivers who are responsible for the care for a period exceeding 24 consecutive hours. They\ndo not refer to services provided by family members of the residents, or to services arranged directly by\nresidents with outside agencies.\nIn the context of home-type care occupancies, these services may include a daily assessment of the\nresident's functioning, awareness of their whereabouts, the making of appointments for residents and\nreminding them of those appointments, the ability and readiness to intervene if a crisis arises for a resident,\nsupervision in areas of nutrition or medication, and provision of transient medical services. Services\nmay also include activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and assistance in the use of\nwashroom facilities, etc. No actual treatment is provided by the caregivers.\nTreatment\nThe ability to evacuate unassisted implies that a person is capable of recognizing and responding to an\nemergency given their physical, cognitive and behavioural abilities, and able to move to a safe location\nwithout the assistance of another person. For example, such persons must be able to arise and walk, or\ntransfer from a bed or chair to a means of mobility, and leave the building or move to a safe location on\ntheir own.\nTreatment Occupancy\n“Treatments” may include such things as surgery, intensive care, and emergency medical intervention.\nTreatment services differ from the services provided by care occupancies like personal care assistance or the\nadministration of medication, and from those provided by business and personal services occupancies like\ndentistry or day procedures.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Amended PageDivision A  1-13\n\n1.2.2.1.Division B\n1.2.2.Symbols and Other Abbreviations\n1.2.2.1.Symbols and Other Abbreviations\n1)ThesymbolsandotherabbreviationsinDivisionBshallhavethemeanings\nassigned to them in Article 1.4.2.1. of Division A and Article 1.3.2.1.",

Documentation of Alternative Solutions.Beyond the purposes of demonstrating\ncompliance and acquiring an installation permit, there are other important reasons for requiring that the\nproponent of an alternative solution submit project documentation (i.e. a compliance report) to the authority\nhaving jurisdiction and for the authority having jurisdiction to retain that documentation for a substantial\nperiod following the installation of a plumbing system:\n• Most jurisdictions require that a plumbing system be maintained in compliance with the codes under\nwhich it was installed. Alternative solutions made possible by objective-based codes may have special\nmaintenance requirements, which would be described in the documentation.\n• Documentation helps consultants perform code compliance assessments of existing buildings or facilities\nbefore they are sold and informs current owners or prospective buyers of existing buildings or facilities of\nany limitations pertaining to their future use or development.\n• Documentation provides design professionals with the basic information necessary to design changes to\nan existing plumbing system.\n• An alternative solution could be invalidated by aproposed alteration to a plumbing system. Designers\nand regulators must therefore know the details of the particular alternative solutions that were integral to\nthe original design. Complete documentation should provide insight as to why one alternative solution\nwas chosen over another.\n• Documentation is the “paper trail” of the alternative solution negotiated between the designer and the\nregulator and should demonstrate that a rational process led to the acceptance of the alternative solution\nas an equivalency.\n• It is possible that over time a particular alternative solution may be shown to be inadequate. It would be\nadvantageous for a jurisdiction to know which plumbing systems included that alternative solution as\npart of their design: documentation will facilitate this type of analysis.\n• Project documentation provides important information to a forensic team that is called to investigate an\naccident or why a design failed to provide the level of performance expected.\nThis subject is discussed in further detail in “Recommended Documentation Requirements for Projects Using\nAlternative Solutions in the Context of Objective-Based Codes,” which was prepared for the CCBFC Task\nGroup on Implementation of Objective-Based Codes and is available on the CBHCC's website.\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements.
