Because olefins cannot be joined \nwith  cements,  barbed  insert  fittings  are  used  for  mechanical  \nassembly.  PE is light weight, low cost, has excellent chemical \nresistance, low coefficient of friction, and is non-toxic.\nPlastic Piping Standards\nMany commercial, industrial, and governmental standards or \nspecifications  are  available  to  assist  the  design  engineer  in  \nspecifying  plastic  piping  systems.  Standards  most  frequently  \nspecified  in  plastic  piping  systems  are  American  Society  for  \nTesting  and  Materials  (ASTM)  Standards.    Below  is  a  list  \nand  description  of  those  standards  most  typically  applied  to  \nindustrial plastic piping.\nModified Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU)\nPolyphenylsulfone  is  a  thermoplastic  that  is  tough,  rigid,  \nhigh-strength, and retains its properties between -148° F and \n302° F (-100° C and 150° C).  PPSU has very high dimensional \nstability;  the  size  change  when  exposed  to  boiling  water  \nor  302°  F  (150°  C)  air  generally  falls  below  0.1  percent.    \nPolyphenylsulfone  is  resistant  to  acids  and  bases.    PPSU  is  \nresistant  to  oxidizing  agents;  therefore,  can  be  cleaned  by  \nbleaches.  However, PPSU is not resistant to low-polar organic \nsolvents  (e.g.,  ketones  and  chlorinated  hydrocarbons)  and  \naromatic  hydrocarbons.    In  addition,  PPSU  is  often  chosen  \nfor  difficult  applications  including  high  water  temperatures,  \nchlorides,  or  when  water  quality  may  increase  the  risk  of   \ndezincification,  a  type  of  corrosion  that  can  adversely  affect  \nmetal fittings.\nBrass\nBrass  is  the  term  used  for  copper  alloys  where  zinc  is  the  \nprinciple  alloying  element  along  with  copper.    Brass  has  a  \nyellow  color,  somewhat  similar  to  gold.    Brass  plumbing  \ncomponents may be machined from extruded shapes, forged, \nor  cast.    This  alloy  is  mainly  used  for  decorative  fixtures,  \nplumbing  components,  and  electrical  applications.    Today,  \nalmost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled.\nCopper (Cu)\nCopper  (Cu)  is  a  natural  element  that  has  historically  been  \nthe  dominant  material  used  in  plumbing,  heating,  cooling,  \nand other piping applications.  Copper is a ductile metal with \nexcellent thermal conductivity and is corrosion resistant.  The \nmaterials  used  in  copper  piping  products  comply  with  the  \nrequirements  of  specifications  established  by  the  American  \nSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM).  The alloy custom-\narily used for copper tube and copper fittings is designated as \nC12200  (Copper  No.  122).    This  alloy  contains  a  minimum  of  \n99.9% pure copper and is deoxidized by the addition of phos-\nphorus.  Other copper alloys may be used.\nCross-Linked Polyethylene (PEX)\nPEX  is  the  common  name  for  cross-linked  polyethylene.  PEX  \ntubing  is  predominantly  used  in  water  distribution  systems,  \nhydronic radiant heating systems, and natural gas systems.  \nAlmost   all   PEX   is   made   from   high   density   polyethylene   \n(HDPE).  PEX contains cross-linked bonds that are introduced \ninto the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a \nthermoset.    Cross-linking  is  accomplished  during  or  after  the  \nextrusion of the tubing.  The required degree of cross-linking, \naccording to ASTM F876, is between 65 to 89 percent.\nThe  cross-linking  process  improves  high-temperature  proper-\nties, toughness, chemical resistance and abrasion resistance.\nCross-linking  may  be  done  by  the  peroxide  (Engel)  method,  \nsilane (moisture cure) method, or electron beam method.  \n\nNIBCO INC.

That  \ninitiative became The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement \nAct  of  1986,  better  known  by  its  original  name,  Proposition  65.  \nThis  Proposition  requires  the  Governor  of  California  to  publish  \na  list  of  chemicals  that  are  known  to  the  State  of  California  \nto   cause   cancer,   birth   defects   or   other   reproductive   harm.   \nOver  750  chemicals  and  materials,  including  many  metals  and  \nplastics,  have  been  listed  as  of  December  12,  2006.  Second,  \nManufacturers  are  required  to  provide  a  \"clear  and  reasonable\"  \nwarning  before  exposing  anyone  to  a  listed  chemical.  This  \nwarning can be given by a variety of means, such as by labeling \na  consumer  product,  by  posting  signs  at  the  workplace,  or  by  \npublishing  notices  in  a  newspaper.  A  Proposition  65  warning  \nmeans  that  the  Manufacturer  issuing  the  warning  believes  that  \none or more listed chemicals is present in its product, even if it is \nonly present in trace quantities.\nKentucky\nMetal insert fittings utilizing a copper crimp ring for cross-linked \npolyethylene  (PEX)  tubing  must  be  produced  and  labeled  as  \nASTM  F1807.  Methods  of  joining  other  than  mentioned  above  \nshall  be  prohibited  unless  documentation  is  provided,  from  the  \nsystems  manufacturer,  honoring  full  warranty  of  the  system  \ninstalled.

Because olefins cannot be joined \nwith  cements,  barbed  insert  fittings  are  used  for  mechanical  \nassembly.  PE is light weight, low cost, has excellent chemical \nresistance, low coefficient of friction, and is non-toxic.\nPlastic Piping Standards\nMany commercial, industrial, and governmental standards or \nspecifications  are  available  to  assist  the  design  engineer  in  \nspecifying  plastic  piping  systems.  Standards  most  frequently  \nspecified  in  plastic  piping  systems  are  American  Society  for  \nTesting  and  Materials  (ASTM)  Standards.    Below  is  a  list  \nand  description  of  those  standards  most  typically  applied  to  \nindustrial plastic piping.\nModified Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU)\nPolyphenylsulfone  is  a  thermoplastic  that  is  tough,  rigid,  \nhigh-strength, and retains its properties between -148° F and \n302° F (-100° C and 150° C).  PPSU has very high dimensional \nstability;  the  size  change  when  exposed  to  boiling  water  \nor  302°  F  (150°  C)  air  generally  falls  below  0.1  percent.    \nPolyphenylsulfone  is  resistant  to  acids  and  bases.    PPSU  is  \nresistant  to  oxidizing  agents;  therefore,  can  be  cleaned  by  \nbleaches.  However, PPSU is not resistant to low-polar organic \nsolvents  (e.g.,  ketones  and  chlorinated  hydrocarbons)  and  \naromatic  hydrocarbons.    In  addition,  PPSU  is  often  chosen  \nfor  difficult  applications  including  high  water  temperatures,  \nchlorides,  or  when  water  quality  may  increase  the  risk  of   \ndezincification,  a  type  of  corrosion  that  can  adversely  affect  \nmetal fittings.\nBrass\nBrass  is  the  term  used  for  copper  alloys  where  zinc  is  the  \nprinciple  alloying  element  along  with  copper.    Brass  has  a  \nyellow  color,  somewhat  similar  to  gold.    Brass  plumbing  \ncomponents may be machined from extruded shapes, forged, \nor  cast.    This  alloy  is  mainly  used  for  decorative  fixtures,  \nplumbing  components,  and  electrical  applications.    Today,  \nalmost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled.\nCopper (Cu)\nCopper  (Cu)  is  a  natural  element  that  has  historically  been  \nthe  dominant  material  used  in  plumbing,  heating,  cooling,  \nand other piping applications.  Copper is a ductile metal with \nexcellent thermal conductivity and is corrosion resistant.  The \nmaterials  used  in  copper  piping  products  comply  with  the  \nrequirements  of  specifications  established  by  the  American  \nSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM).  The alloy custom-\narily used for copper tube and copper fittings is designated as \nC12200  (Copper  No.  122).    This  alloy  contains  a  minimum  of  \n99.9% pure copper and is deoxidized by the addition of phos-\nphorus.  Other copper alloys may be used.\nCross-Linked Polyethylene (PEX)\nPEX  is  the  common  name  for  cross-linked  polyethylene.  PEX  \ntubing  is  predominantly  used  in  water  distribution  systems,  \nhydronic radiant heating systems, and natural gas systems.  \nAlmost   all   PEX   is   made   from   high   density   polyethylene   \n(HDPE).  PEX contains cross-linked bonds that are introduced \ninto the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a \nthermoset.    Cross-linking  is  accomplished  during  or  after  the  \nextrusion of the tubing.  The required degree of cross-linking, \naccording to ASTM F876, is between 65 to 89 percent.\nThe  cross-linking  process  improves  high-temperature  proper-\nties, toughness, chemical resistance and abrasion resistance.\nCross-linking  may  be  done  by  the  peroxide  (Engel)  method,  \nsilane (moisture cure) method, or electron beam method.",

That  \ninitiative became The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement \nAct  of  1986,  better  known  by  its  original  name,  Proposition  65.  \nThis  Proposition  requires  the  Governor  of  California  to  publish  \na  list  of  chemicals  that  are  known  to  the  State  of  California  \nto   cause   cancer,   birth   defects   or   other   reproductive   harm.   \nOver  750  chemicals  and  materials,  including  many  metals  and  \nplastics,  have  been  listed  as  of  December  12,  2006.  Second,  \nManufacturers  are  required  to  provide  a  \"clear  and  reasonable\"  \nwarning  before  exposing  anyone  to  a  listed  chemical.  This  \nwarning can be given by a variety of means, such as by labeling \na  consumer  product,  by  posting  signs  at  the  workplace,  or  by  \npublishing  notices  in  a  newspaper.  A  Proposition  65  warning  \nmeans  that  the  Manufacturer  issuing  the  warning  believes  that  \none or more listed chemicals is present in its product, even if it is \nonly present in trace quantities.\nKentucky\nMetal insert fittings utilizing a copper crimp ring for cross-linked \npolyethylene  (PEX)  tubing  must  be  produced  and  labeled  as  \nASTM  F1807.
