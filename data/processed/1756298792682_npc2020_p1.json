This may\ninvolve the adoption of the NPC without change or with modifications to suit local needs,\nand the enactment of other laws and regulations regarding plumbing system design and\ninstallation, including requirements for professional involvement.\nThe NPC is a model code in the sense that it helps promote consistency among provincial\nand territorial plumbing codes. Persons involved in the design or installation of plumbing\nsystems should consult the provincial or territorial jurisdiction concerned to find out which\nplumbing code is applicable.\nThis edition of the NPC succeeds the 2015 edition.\nDevelopment of the National Model Codes\nThe CCBFC, an independent committee established by the National Resea\nrch Council of\nCanada (NRC), is responsible for the content of the National Model Codes. The CCBFC\nis made up of volunteers from across the country and from all facets of the Codes-user\ncommunity. Members of the CCBFC and its standing committees include\nbuilders, engineers,\nskilled trade workers, architects, building owners, building operators, fire and building\nofficials, manufacturers, and representatives of general interests.\nThe CCBFC is\nadvised on scope, policy and technical issues pertaining to the Codes by the\nProvincial/Territorial Policy Advisory Committee on Codes (PTPACC), which is a committee\nof senior representatives from provincial/territorial ministries responsible for building,\nfire, plum\nbing, and energy regulation in their jurisdictions. The PTPACC was created by\nthe provinces and territories, with provision of guidance to the CCBFC as one of its main\nfunctions. Through the PTPACC, the provinces and territories are engaged in every phase of\nthe Codes d\nevelopment process.\nCodes Canada staff within the Construction Research Centre at the NRC provide technical\nand administrative support to the CCBFC and its standing committees, and coordinate the\nprovision of evidence-based research to inform Codes development. The NRC publishes the\nNational Model Codes and periodic revisions to the Codes to address pressing issues.\nThe broader Codes-user community also makes significant contributions to the Codes\ndevelopment process by submitting requests for changes or additions to the Codes and by\ncommenting on the proposed changes during the public reviews that precede each new\nedition.\nThe CCBFC takes into consideration the advice received from the provinces and territories as\nwell as Codes users' comments at each stage of Codes development. The scope and content of\nthe National Model Codes are determined on a consensus basis, which involves the review of\ntechnical, policy and practical concerns and discussion of the implications of these concerns.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020v\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nMore information on the Codes development process is available on the NRC's website.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nThe NPC sets out technical provisions for the design and installation of new plumbing\nsystems. It also applies to the extension, alteration, renewal and repair of existing plumbing\nsystems.\nThe NPC establishes requirements to address the following four objectives:\n•safety\n• health\n• protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage\n• environment\nCode provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings and facilities\nthat might be considered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive\nconsensus process used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see\nthe section\nentitled Development of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided\nwhich characteristics should be regulated through the NPC.\nThe provisions of the NPC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required\nto adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they\nare adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become\nminimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required\nto achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority.\nThe NPC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory, becomes\na regulation. It is not a guideline on plumbing system design or installation. The design of a\ntechnically sound plumbing system depends upon many factors beyond compliance with\nplumbing regulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners\nwho have received appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar\nwith the principles of good plumbing practice and experience using reference manuals and\ntechnical guides.\nThe NPC does not list acceptable proprietary plumbing products. It establishes the criteria\nthat plumbing materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are\nexplicitly stated in the NPC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product\nstandards published by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the\nstandards related to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NPC.\nCode Requirements\nMost NPC requirements address at least one ofthe Code's four stated objectives (safety,\nhealth, protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage, and\nenvironment).\nIn processing proposed changes or additions to any of the National Model C\nodes, the\nCCBFC considers many issues such as the following:\n• Does the proposed requirement provide the minimum level of performance—and\nno more than the minimum—needed to achieve the Code's objectives?\n• Will persons responsible for Code compliance be able to act on or implement the\nrequirement using commonly accepted practices?\n• Will enforcement agencies be able to enforce the requirement?\n• Are the costs of implementing the requirement justifiable?\n• Have the potential policy implications of the requirement been identified and\naddressed?\n• Is there broad consensus on this requirement among Code users representing all\nfacets of the plumbing system design and construction industries, as well as among\nprovincial and territorial governments?\nGuidelines for requesting changes to the NPC are available on the NRC's website.\nviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nObjective-Based Code Format\nThe NPC has been published in an objective-based code format since 2005.\nAs described in more detail in the section entitled Structure of the NPC, the Code comprises\nthree Divisions:\n• Division A, which defines the scope of the Code and contains the objectives, the\nfunctional statements and the conditions necessary to achieve compliance;\n• Division B, which contains acceptable solutions (commonly referred to as “tech\nnical\nrequirements”) deemed to satisfy the objectives and functional statements listed in\nDivision A; and\n• Division C, which contains administrative provisions.\nMostoftherequirementsinDivisionBarelinkedtothreetypesofinformation:\n• objectives (Code objectives, such as safety or health, which individual requirements\nhelp to address),\n• functional statements (statements of the functions of the plumbing system that a\nparticular requirement helps to achieve), and\n• intent statements (detailed statements of the specific intent of the requirement).\nObjectives\nThe NPC's objectives are fully defined in Section 2.2. of Division A.\nThe objectives describe, in broad terms, the overall goals that the NPC's requirements are\nintended to achieve. They serve to define the boundaries of the subject areas the Code\naddresses. However,\nthe Code does not address all the issues that might be considered\nto fall within those boundaries.\nThe objectives describe undesirable situations and their consequences, which the Code\naims to prevent from occurring in plumbing systems. The wording of most of the\ndefinitions of the objectives includes two key phrases: “limit the probability” and\n“unacceptable risk.” The phrase “limit the probability” is used to acknowledge that the\nNPC cannot entirely prevent those undesirable situations from happening. The phrase\n“unacceptable risk” acknowledges that the NPC cannot eliminate all risk: the “acceptable\nrisk” is the risk remaining once compliance with the Code has been achieved.\nThe objectives are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be used on their own in the\ndesign and approval processes.\nThe objectives attributed to the requirements or portions of requirements in Division B\narelistedinatableinSection2.8.ofDivisionB.\nFunctional Statements\nThe NPC's functional statements are defined in Section 3.2. of Division A.\nThe functional statements are more detailed than the objectives. They describe conditions\nin the plumbing system that help satisfy the objectives. The functional statements and the\nobjectives are interconnected. There may be several functional statements related to any\none objective, and a given functional statement may describe a function of the plumbing\nsystem that serves to achieve more than one objective.\nLike objectives, functional statements are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be\nused on their own in the design and approval processes.\nThe functional statements attributed to the requirements or portions of requirement\nsin\nDivision B are listed in a table in Section 2.8. of Division B.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020vii\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nIntent Statements\nIntent statements explain the basic th\ninking behind each Code provision contained in\nDivision B. Intent statements, each of which is unique to the provision with which it is\nassociated, explain how requirements help to achieve their attributed objectives and\nfunctional statements. Like the obje\nctives, the intent statements are expressed in terms\nof risk avoidance and expected performance. They offer insight into the views of the\nresponsible standing committee on what the Code provisions are intended to achieve.\nThe intent statements serve explanatory purposes only and do not form an integral part of\nthe Code provisions. As such, they are similar in function to the explanatory Notes at the\nend of each Part. Due to the sheer volume of intent statements—hundreds for the NPC\nalone—they are made available as a separate electronic document entitled “Supplement\nto the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is posted on the NRC's website.\nAll this additional information—objectives, functional statements and intent statements—is\nintended to facilitate the implementation of the Code in two ways:\n• Clarity of intent: The objectives, functional statements andintent statements\nlinked\nto a Code requirement clarify the reasoning behind that requirement and facilitate\nunderstanding of what must be done to satisfy that requirement. This added information\nmay also help avoid disputes between practitioners and officials over these ty\npes\nof issues.\n• Flexibility: The additional information allows for flexibility in Code compliance. A\nperson seeking to propose a new method or material not described or covered in th\ne\nCode will be able to use the added information to understand the expected level of\nperformance that their alternative solution must achieve to satisfy the Code.\nStructure of the NPC\nThe NPC is organized into three Divisions.\nDivision A: Compliance, Objectives and Functional Statements\nDivision A defines the scope of the NPC and presents the objectives that the Code\naddresses and the functions the plumbing system must perform to help to satisfy those\nobjectives.\nDivision A cannot be used on its own as a basis for designing and installing a plumbing\nsystem or for evaluating a plumbing system's compliance with the Code.\nDivision B: Acceptable Solutions\nThe term “acceptable solutions” refers to the technical requirements contained in the\nCode. It reflects the principle that plumbing codes establish an acceptable level of risk\nor performance and underlines the fact that a code cannot describe all possible valid\ndesign and installation options. Acceptable solutions represent the minimum level of\nperformance that will satisfy the NPC's objectives and that is acceptable to an authority\nthat adopts the NPC into law or regulation.\nMost of the requirements in Division B—the acceptable solutions—are linked to at least\none objective and functional statement found in Division A. These linkages play an\nimportant role in allowing objective-based codes to accommodate innovation.\nIt is expected that the majority of Code users will primarily follow the acceptable\nsolutions presented in Division B and that they will consult Division A only when seeking\nclarification on the application of Division B's requirements to a particular situation,\nwhen considering an alternative solution, or when looking up the definition of selected\nterms in the context of the NPC.\nviiiNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nDivision C: Administrative Provisions\nDivision C contains administrative provisions relating to the application of the Code.\nMany provinces and territories establish their own administrative provisions upon\nadopting or adapting the NPC; having all the administrative provisions in one Division\nfacilitates their customization to suit jurisdictional needs.\nIn addition, a separate document entitled Administrative Requirements for Use with\nthe National Building Code of Canada 1985 is automatically adopted, in accordance\nwith Article 2.2.1.1. of Division C, if the authority having jurisdiction does not provide\nother administrative requirements.\nRelationship between Division A and Division B\nSentence 1.2.1.1.(1) of Division A is a very important sentence: it is a precise statement of\nthe relationship between Divisions A and B and is central to the concept of objective-based\ncodes.\n1)Compliance with this Code shall be achieved by\na)  complying with the applicable acceptable solutions in Division B (see Note\nA-1.2.1.1.(1)(a)), or\nb)  using alternative solutions that will achieve at least the minimum level of\nperformance required by Division B in the areas defined by the objectives\nand functional statements attributed tothe applicable acceptable solutions\n(see Note A-1.2.1.1.(1)(b)).\nClause (a) makes it clear that the acceptable solutions in Division B are automatically\ndeemed to satisfy the linked objectives and functional statements of Division A.\nClause (b) makes it clear that alternative solutions can be used in lieu of compliance\nwith the acceptable solutions. However, todo something different from the acceptable\nsolutions described in Division B, a proponent must show that their proposed alternative\nsolution will perform at least as well as the acceptable solution(s) it is replacing. The\nobjectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solution(s) identify the\nareas of performance where this equivalence must be demonstrated.\nAdditional Information\nNumbering System\nA consistent numbering system has been used throughout the National Model Codes. The\nfirst number indicates the Part of the Code; the second, the Section in the Part; the third,\nthe Subsection; and the fourth, the Article in the Subsection. The detailed provisions are\nfound at the Sentence level (indicated by numbers in brackets), and Sentences may be\nbroken down into Clauses and Subclauses. This structure is illustrated as follows:\n3Part\n3.5.\nSection\n3.5.2.\nSubsection\n3.5.2.1.\nArticle\n3.5.2.1.(2)\nSentence\n3.5.2.1.(2)(a)\nClause\n3.5.2.1.(2)(a)(i)\nSubclause\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020ix\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nMeaning of the Words “And” and “Or” between the Clauses and Subclauses\nof a Sentence\nMultiple Clauses and Subclauses are connected by the word “and” or “or” at the end of\nthe second last Clause or Subclause in the series. Although this connecting word appears\nonly once, it is meant to apply to all the preceding Clauses or Subclauses within that series.\nFor example, in a series of five Clauses—(a) to (e)—in a Sentence, the appearance of the\nword “and” at the end of Clause (d) means that all Clauses in the Sentence are connected\nto each other with the word “and.” Similarly, in a series of five Clauses—(a) to (e)—in a\nSentence, the appearance of the word “or” at the end of Clause (d) means that all Clauses\nin the Sentence are connected to each other with the word “or.”\nIn all cases, it is important to note that a Clause (and its Subclauses, if any) must always\nbe read in conjunction with its introductory text appearing at the beginning of the\nSentence. Moreover, the connecting words “and” and “or” must be read in the context\nof the Sentence. In particular, the use of the word “and” as a connecting word does not\nnecessarily mean that all Clauses (or Subclauses) are applicable for compliance with\nthe Sentence.\nChange Indication\nAs a courtesy to Code users, efforts have been made to identify technical changes relative\nto the 2015 edition. Where a technical addition or revision has been made, a vertical line\nhas been added in the margin next to the affected provision to indicate the approximate\nlocation of the new or revised content. No change indication is provided for editorial\nrevisions or for renumbered or deleted content.\nUnits\nAll values in the NPC, other than nominal pipe sizes, are given in metric units. Some of\nthe metric values in the Code have been converted and rounded from imperial values. A\nconversion table of imperial equivalents for the most common units used in plumbing\nsystem design and installation is located at the end of the Code.\nComplementary Publications\nThe following publications are referenced in the NPC 2020 or facilitate the application\nof its requirements:\nNational Building Code of Canada 2020\nSupplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements\nThese and other Code documents published by the NRC are made available in free\nelectronic format on the NRC's website.\nCommercial Reproduction\nCopyright for the NPC is owned by the NRC.

Activities of the NSS are coordinated by the Standards Council of\nCanada (SCC), which accredits standards development organizations, certification bodies,\ntesting and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, among others.\nThe SCC is a non-profit federal Crown corporation responsible for the coordination of\nvoluntary standardization in Canada. It also coordinates Canadian participation in voluntary\ninternational standardization activities.\nCanadian Standards\nMany of the standards referenced in the NPC are published by standards development\norganizations accredited in Canada. As part of the accreditation requirements, these\norganizations adhere to the principle of consensus, which generally means substantial\nmajority agreement of a committee comprising a balance of producer, user and general\ninterest members, and the consideration of all negative comments. The standards\ndevelopment organizations also have formal procedures for the balloting and second-level\nreview of standards prepared under their oversight.\nThe following organizations are accredited as standards development organizations in\nCanada:\n• Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI)\n• ASTM International\n• Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ)\n• Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB)\n•CSAGroup\n• International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO)\n•ULCStandards\n• Underwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL)\nTable 1.3.1.2. of Division B lists the standards referenced in the NPC. Standards proposed to\nbe referenced in the NPC are reviewed to ensure that their content is compatible with the\nCode. Thereafter, referenced standards are reviewed as needed during each Code cycle.\nStandards development organizations are asked to provide information on any changes in the\nstatus of their standards referenced in the NPC—withdrawals, amendments, new editions,\netc. This information is passed on to the CCBFC, its standing committees, the provinces and\nterritories, and interested stakeholders, all of whom are given the opportunity to identify\nany problems associated with the changes. These bodies do not necessarily review in detail\nthe revised standards; rather, the approach relies on the consensus process involved in the\nmaintenance of the standards and on the extensive knowledge and experience of committee\nmembers, provincial or territorial staff, NRC staff, and consulted stakeholders to identify\nchanges in the standards that might create problems in the Code.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xiii\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nNon-Canadian Standards\nA number of subject areas for which the standards development organizations accredited in\nCanada have not developed standards are covered in the NPC. In these cases, the Code often\nreferences standards develop\ned by organizations in other countries, such as the American\nSociety of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the\nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA). These standards are developed using processes\nthat may differ from those use\nd by the standards development organizations accredited in\nCanada; nevertheless, the standards have been reviewed by the relevant standing committees\nand found to be acceptable.\nConformity Assessment\nThe NPC establishes minimum measures, which are set out within its own text or within\nreferenced standards. However, the NPC does not set out who is responsible for assessing\nconformity to the measures or how those with this responsibility might carry it out. This\nresponsibility is usually established by the governing legislation of the adopting provinces\nand territories. Provincial or territorial authorities should be consulted to determine who is\nresponsible for conformity assessment within their jurisdiction.\nThose persons responsible for ensuring that materials, appliances, systems and equipment\nmeet the requirements of this Code have several means avai\nlable to assist them, ranging\nfrom on-site inspection to the use of certification services provided by accredited third-party\norganizations. Test reports or mill certificates provided by manufacturers or suppliers can\nalso assist in the acceptance of products. Engineering r\neports may be required for more\ncomplex products.\nTesting\nThe SCC accredits testing and calibration laboratories that are capable of reliably testing\nproducts to specified standards. The test results produced by these organizations can be\nused in the certification, evaluation and qualification of products for compliance with\nCode provisions. The SCC's website (www.scc.ca) lists accredited testing and calibration\nlaboratories, along with their scope of accreditation.\nCertification\nCertification is the confirmation by an independent organization that a product, process,\nservice or system meets a requirement. Certification may entail physical examination,\ntesting as specified in appropriate standards, an initial plant inspection, and/\nor follow-up\nunannounced plant inspections. This procedure leads to the issuing of a formal assurance\nor declaration, by means of a certification mark or certificate, that the product, process,\nservice or system is in full conformity with specified provisions.\nIn some cases, a product for which no standard exists can be certified using procedures\nand criteria developed by an accredited certification body and specifically designed to\nmeasure the performance of that product.\nCertification bodies publish lists of certified products and companies. The SCC's website\n(www.scc.ca) lists accredited certification bodies, along with their scope of accreditation.\nSeveral organizations, including the Canadian Construction Materials Centre (CCMC) at\nthe NRC, offer product certification services.\nEvaluation\nAn evaluation is a written opinion by an independent professional organization that a\nproduct will perform its intended function. An evaluation is often done to determine the\nability of an innovative product, for which no standards exist, to satisfy the intent of a\nCode requirement. Follow-up plant inspections are not normally part of the evaluation\nprocess.\nxivNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nQualification\nQualification evaluates the ability of a product to perform its intended function by\nverifying that it meets the requirements of a standard. Qualification normally includes\nsome follow-up plant inspection. Some organizations publish lists of qualified products\nthat meet the specified requirements. Some organizations qualify product manufacturing\nand/or testing facilities for compliance with the Code and relevant standards.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xv\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nxviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nCanadian Commission on Building and\nFire Codes and Standing Committees\nCanadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes\nD.

In fact, if it can be determined that a design meets all the applicable acceptable\nsolutions in Division B, there is no need to consult the objectives and functional statements in Division A to\ndetermine its compliance.\nA-1.2.1.1.(1)(b)  Code Compliance via Alternative Solutions.Where a design differs from the\nacceptable solutions in Division B, then it should be treated as an “alternative solution.” A proponent of an\nalternative solution must demonstrate that the alternative solution addresses the same issues as the applicable\nacceptable solutions in Division B and their attributed objectives and functional statements. However, because\nthe objectives and functional statements are entirelyqualitative, demonstrating compliance with them in\nisolation is not possible. Therefore, Clause 1.2.1.1.(1)(b) identifies the principle that Division B establishes the\nquantitative performance targets that alternative solutions must meet. In many cases, these targets are not\ndefined very precisely by the acceptable solutions—certainly far less precisely than would be the case with\na true performance code, which would have quantitative performance targets and prescribed methods of\nperformance measurement for all aspects of building performance. Nevertheless, Clause 1.2.1.1.(1)(b) makes it\nclear that an effort must be made to demonstrate that analternative solution will perform as well as a design\nthat would satisfy the applicable acceptable solutions in Division B—not “well enough” but “as well as.”\nIn this sense, it is Division B that defines the boundaries between acceptable risks and the “unacceptable” risks\nreferred to in the statements of the Code's objectives, i.e., the risk remaining once the applicable acceptable\nsolutions in Division B have been implemented represents the residual level of risk deemed to be acceptable by\nthe broad base of Canadians who have taken part in the consensus process used to develop the Code.\nLevel of Performance\nWhere Division B offers a choice between several possible designs, it is likely that these designs may\nnot all provide exactly the same level of performance. Among a number of possible designs satisfying\nacceptable solutions in Division B, the design providing the lowest level of performance should generally\nbe considered to establish the minimum acceptable level of performance to be used in evaluating alternative\nsolutions for compliance with the Code.\nSometimes a single design will be used as an alternative solution to several sets of acceptable solutions\nin Division B. In this case, the level of performance required of the alternative solution should be at least\nequivalent to the overall level of performance established by all the applicable sets of acceptable solutions\ntaken as a whole.\nEach provision in Division B has been analyzed to determine what it is intended to achieve. The resultant\nintent statements clarify what undesirable results each provision seeks to preclude. These statements\nare not a legal component of the Code, but are advisory in nature, and can help Code users establish\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements.

They are published as a separate electronic document entitled\n“Supplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is available on the NRC's website.\nAreas of Performance\nA subset of the acceptable solutions in Division B may establish criteria for particular types of designs (e.g.,\ncertain types of materials, components, assemblies, or systems). Often such subsets of acceptable solutions\nare all attributed to the same objective: OH2, Sanitation, for example. In some cases, the designs that are\nnormally used to satisfy this subset of acceptable solutions might also provide some benefits that could be\nrelated to some other objective: OP5, Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage,\nfor example. However, if none of the applicable acceptable solutions are linked to Objective OP5, it is not\nnecessary that alternative solutions proposed to replace these acceptable solutions provide a similar benefit\nrelated to Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage. In other words, the\nacceptable solutions in Division B establish acceptable levels of performance for compliance with the Code\nonly in those areas defined by the objectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solutions.\nApplicable Acceptable Solutions\nIn demonstrating that an alternative solution will perform as well as a design that would satisfy the\napplicable acceptable solutions in Division B, its evaluation should not be limited to comparison with the\nacceptable solutions to which an alternative is proposed. It is possible that acceptable solutions elsewhere\nin the Code also apply. The proposed alternative solution may be shown to perform as well as the most\napparent acceptable solution, which it is replacing, but may not perform as well as other relevant acceptable\nsolutions. For example, an innovative piping material may perform adequately in a drainage system, but\nmay not meet combustibility requirements elsewhere in the Code. All applicable acceptable solutions\nshould be taken into consideration in demonstrating the compliance of an alternative solution.\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)  Defined Terms.\nAuxiliary Water Supply\nThe auxiliary water supply may include water from a secondary potable water supply or from any natural\nsource, such as a well, lake, spring, stream or harbour. It may also include waste water (but not sanitary\ndrainage) from industrial processes, such as cooling towers, or from storm retention ponds. These sources\nmay be polluted or contaminated and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the primary\nwater purveyor does not have sanitary control. It is generally accepted that there are two categories of\nauxiliary water supply:\n(a) any public potable water supply over which the primary water purveyor does not have sanitary\ncontrol, or\n(b) any private water supply, other than the primary potable water supply, that is on or available to the\npremises.\nClass 3 Fire Sprinkler/Standpipe Systems\nIn Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems, water is supplied to the storage facilities from the public water\nsupply and is maintained in potable condition. Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems resemble Class 1\nfire sprinkler/standpipe systems in all other respects.\nClear-Water Waste\nExamples of clear-water waste are the waste waters discharged from a drinking fountain, cooling jacket, air\nconditioner or relief valve outlet.\nEmergency Floor Drains\nThere are two types of floor drains. One is an emergency floor drain installed to avoid flooding in a\nbuilding from any pipe or fixture failure. The other encompasses floor drains installed to receive discharge\nfrom specific pieces of equipment; this type is defined as a fixture.\n1-12  Division ANational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision AA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nIllustrations for Defined Terms\nNormal flow conditions\nBackflow conditions\nleakage port\n(a) Reduced pressure principle backflow \n      preventer assembly\ninlet\nwater supply pipe\nvalve\ncheck valve\nleakage port\nvalve\ncheck valve\nE G 01117 A\ndifferential relief valve\nAssembly of differential valves and \ncheck valves used as a backflow preventer\n(b)\nFigure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-A\nBackflow preventer\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division A  1-13\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)Division A\nsink or lavatory\nflood level rim\nbathtub\nflush valve water closet\nflood level rim\nflood level rim\nE G 01118 A\nFigure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B\nBack-siphonage\nNotes to Figure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B:\n(1) Figure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B shows a situation that is fairly common in old buildings.

The water flow rate of automatic compensating mixing\nvalves can be found in ASSE 1016/ASME A112.1016/CSA B125.16, “Performance Requirements for Automatic\nCompen\nsating Valves for Individual Showers and Tub/Shower Combinations.”\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-79\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-2.2.10.6.(4) and (5)Division B\nA-2.2.10.6.(4) and (5)  Automatic Shut-off of Water Flow.Examples of water shut-off devices\ninclude occupant sensors and self-closing valves.\nA-2.2.10.6.(7)  Manually Operated Valves.Manually operated valves are also known in the industry\nas supply line stops.\nA-2.2.10.7.  Hot Water Temperature.Hot water delivered at 60°C, a typical thermostat setting for\nstorage-type service water heaters, will severely burn human skin in 1 to 5 s. Consequently, Article 2.2.10.7.\nsets an upper limit on the temperature of water discharging from shower heads and into bathtubs. The\nwater temperature is maintained at or below this limitthrough the installation and adjustment of automatic\ncompensating valves or temperature-limiting devices. Compliance with the Article reduces the risk of scalding\nin showers and bathtubs, which could result in severe burns, and the risk of thermal shock in showers, which\ncould lead to falls. Children, older adults and people with disabilities are particularly at risk of scalding because\nthey are not always able to remove themselves quickly from a shower or bathtub if the water becomes too hot.\nAtawatertemperatureof49°C,thetimeforascaldburntooccuronanadultisnearly10min,whereasthe\ntime for a scald burn to occur on an older adult is only 2 min because their skin is thinner and less vascularized.\nAt a water temperature of 43°C, scald burns occur only after several hours of exposure. Therefore, setting 43°C\nas the maximum temperature for water discharging from shower heads and into bathtubs provides suitable\nprotection from scald burns in healthcare facilities and seniors' residences.\nAlthough the temperature of water discharging into otherfixtures, such as lavatories, sinks, laundry trays and\nbidets, is not addressed by Article 2.2.10.7., a risk of scalding may nonetheless exist at such fixtures.\nIt should be noted that pressure-balanced valves are sensitive to seasonal changes in the temperature of the\ncold water supply and may require adjustments throughout the year to avoid exceeding the maximum water\ntemperature prescribed in Article 2.2.10.7.\nA-2.2.10.9.(3)  Bubblers.Bubblers installed on other than drinking fountains may have proven acceptable\non the basis of past performance in some localities and their acceptance under this Code may be warranted.\nA-2.2.10.16.(1)  Air Admittance Valve.An air admittance valve is a device that is closed by gravity\nand seals the vent terminal at zero differential pressure (no flow conditions) and under positive internal\npressures. The valve allows air to enter the drainage system without the use of a vent extended to outside air\nand prevents trap siphonage.\nThe material of the diaphragm can be damaged by exposure to acidic or corrosive fumes in the ambient\natmosphere; therefore, air admittance valves should notbe installed in locations where there is a potential for\nexposure to such fumes.\nA-2.3.2.6.(1)  Mechanical Joints.Storm sewer blockage can cause mechanical joints at the base of\nleaders to fail, which results in flooding. The failureoccurs because the cleanout joints at the base of the\nrainwater leaders are not able to withstand the water column pressure. To avoid such failures, it is necessary\nto ensure that storm water systems installed using mechanical joints be braced and/or restrained at the\nends of branches, changes in direction and elevation, at dead ends and at other locations as required by the\nmanufacturer to prevent the separation of joints due to internal pressure, mechanical stress or seismic events.\nCare should be taken to replace cleanouts properly after maintenance or testing.\n2-80  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.3.3.11.(2)\nA-2.3.3.9.

Determination of Hydraulic Loads and Nominal Pipe Sizes of Drainage Pipes.\nHydraulic Loads\nThe hydraulic load that is imposed by a fixture is represented by a factor called a fixture unit. Fixture\nunits are dimensionless and take into account the rate of discharge, time of discharge and frequency of\ndischarge of the fixture.\nConfusion often arises when attempts are made to convert fixture units to litres per second because there is\nno straightforward relationship between the two. The proportion of the total number of fixtures that can be\nexpected to discharge simultaneously in a large system is smaller than in a small system. For example,\ndoubling the number of fixtures in a system will not double the peak flow that the system must carry,\nalthough of course the flow will be increased somewhat. Figure A-2.4.10.-A shows the relationship that\nwas used in constructing the tables ofcapacities of stacks, branches, sanitary building drains and sanitary\nbuilding sewers (Tables 2.4.10.6.-A to 2.4.10.6.-C).\nAlthough the curve in Figure A-2.4.10.-A was used to prepare the Code tables, it was not included in the\nNational Plumbing Code. Instead, a single approximate conversion factor is given in the Code so that\na continuous flow from a fixture may be converted from litres per second to fixture units in order to\ndetermine the total hydraulic load on the sanitary drainage system. The conversion factor, which is given in\nSentence 2.4.10.3.(1), is 31.7 fixture units per litres per second. The discharge from a continuous flow fixture\nin litres per second when multiplied by 31.7 gives the hydraulic load in fixture units, and that load is added\nto the fixture unit load from other fixtures to give the total load that the sanitary drainage pipe must carry.\nThe hydraulic load that is produced by storm water runoff depends both on the size of the area that\nis drained and local rainfall intensity. The capacities of storm drainage pipes and combined sewers in\nTables 2.4.10.9., 2.4.10.10. and 2.4.10.11. have been expressed in terms of the number of litres that they can\ncarry when the local rainfall intensity is 1 mm in 15 min. The hydraulic load for a particular location is\nobtained by simply multiplying the rainfall intensity figure given in Appendix C of Division B of the NBC\nby the actual area drained as specified in Sentence 2.4.10.4.(1).\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-91\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-2.4.10.Division B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n05001 0001 5002 0002 5003 000\nFixture units\nDemand, L/s\nEG01151A\nFigure A-2.4.10.-A\nRelationship between fixture units and demand\nIn the case of restricted-flow drains, the hydraulic load from storm water runoff must be calculated using\nmanufacturer discharge flow rates of specific drains in the case of roofs, and water-flow restrictors in\nthe case of paved areas.\nWhen plumbing fixtures are connected to a combined sewer, the hydraulic load from the fixtures must be\nconverted from fixture units to litres or, in the case of continuous flow, from litres per second to litres so\nthat these loads can be added to the hydraulic loads from roofs and paved surfaces. As already pointed out,\nthe relationship between fixture units and litres persecond and, consequently, the relationship between\nfixture units and litres is not straightforward, and an approximate conversion factor has been adopted. The\nconversion factor given in Sentence 2.4.10.5.(1) is 9.1 L/fixture unit, except where the load is less than 260\nfixtureunitsinwhichcasearoundfigureof2360Listobeused.Inthecaseofcontinuous-flowfixtures\nthat are connected to combined sewers or storm sewers, the conversion factor given in Sentence 2.4.10.3.(2)\nis 900 L per L/s. This conversion factor is not an approximation but an exact calculation.\nTheconversionfactorsgiveninSentences2.4.10.3.(1) and 2.4.10.5.(1) are designed to convert in one\ndirection only, and must not be used to convert from fixture units to litres per second in the one instance,\nnor from litres to fixture units in the other instance.\nIn summary, it should be noted that\n(a) in sanitary drainage systems, all hydraulic loads are converted to fixture units, and\n(b) in storm drainage systems or combined drainage systems, all hydraulic loads are converted to litres.\nProcedure for Selecting Nominal Pipe Sizes\nThe following is an outline, with examples, of the procedures to be followed in determining the nominal\npipe size of each section of drainage piping.\n(1) Sanitary drainage pipes, such as branches,stacks, building drains or building sewers:\n(a) Determine the load in fixture units from allfixtures except continuous-flow fixtures;\n(b) Determine the load in litres per second from all continuous-flow fixtures and multiply the\nnumber of litres per second by 31.7 to obtain the number of fixture units;\n(c) Add loads (a) and (b) to obtain the total hydraulic load on the pipe in fixture units; and\n(d) Consult the appropriate table from Table 2.4.10.6.-A, 2.4.10.6.-B or 2.4.10.6.-C to select the\nnominal pipe size.\n(Note that no pipe may be smaller than the NPS permitted in Subsection 2.4.9.)\n(2) Storm drainage pipes, such as gutters, leaders, horizontal pipes, building drains or building sewers:\n2-92  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.4.10.\n(a) Determine the area in square metres of roofs and paved surfaces according to\nSentence 2.4.10.4.(1);\n(b) Determine the local rainfall intensity (15 min rainfall) from Appendix C of Division B of the NBC;\n(c) Multiply (a) by (b) to obtain the hydraulic load in litres;\n(d) If a fixture discharges a continuous flow to the storm system, multiply its load in litres per\nsecond by 900 to obtain the hydraulic load in litres;\n(e) If flow control roof drains are used, compute the discharge rate based on rain intensity, retention\nduration, accumulation height and roof area from the roof drain manufacturers' data;\n(f) Add loads (c) or (e), and (d) to obtain the total hydraulic load on the pipe in litres; and\n(g) Consult the appropriate table from Table 2.4.10.9., 2.4.10.10. or 2.4.10.11. to select the nominal\npipe size of the pipe or gutter.\n(Note that no pipe may be smaller than the NPS permitted in Subsection 2.4.9.)\n(3) Combined drainage pipes, such as building sewers:\n(a) Determine the total load in fixture units from all fixtures except continuous-flow fixtures;\n(b) If the fixture unit load exceeds 260, multiply it by 9.1 to determine the equivalent hydraulic load\nin litres.

Since air chambers made from a piece of\nvertical pipe do not provide acceptable protection, pre-manufactured water hammer arresters are required\nto address this potential problem. Water hammer arresters need not be installed at every valve or faucet, nor\nin every piping system.\nA-2.6.1.11.(1)  Thermal Expansion.To accommodate the increase in pressure caused by thermal\nexpansion within a closed water distribution system, one of the following should be installed:\n(1) a suitably sized diaphragm expansion tank designed for use within a potable water system,\n(2) an auxiliary thermal expansion relief valve (T.E.R.valve) conforming to CSA B125.3, “Plumbing fittings,”\nset at a pressure of 550 kPa or less and designed for repeated use, or\n(3) other means acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction.\nA-2.6.1.12.(1)  Service Water Heaters.Storing hot water at temperatures below 60°C in the hot water\ntank or in the delivery system may lead to the growth of legionella bacteria. Contemporary electric water heater\ntanks experience temperature stratification and thus tend to have legionella bacteria in the lower parts of the\ntank. Article 2.6.1.12. specifies a thermostat setting of 60°C, which addresses the concern over the growth of\nlegionella bacteria in electric hot water storage tanks and is enforceable without introducing unnecessary\ncomplications. The growth of legionella bacteria is not aconcern for other types of water heaters with different\ndesigns that use different fuels.\nElectrically heated water heaters are shipped with the thermostat set at 60°C. Article 2.6.1.12. is included in\nthe NPC to formalize this de facto temperature setting as a requirement. The thermostats have graduated\ntemperature markings to allow such a setting, whichis not the case with gas- or oil-heated water heaters.\nA-2.6.2.4.(2)  Backflow from Fire Protection Systems.The following document is considered to be\ngood engineering practice when selecting a backflow preventer for installation on a fire protection system:\nAWWA M14, “Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control.”\nTable A-2.6.2.4.(2)\nSelection Guide for Backflow Prevention Devices on Fire Sprinkler and Standpipe Systems\nSystems Made with Potable Water\nSystem Materials\n(2)\nSystems Not Made with Potable Water\nSystem Materials\n(2)\nCSA St\nandard\nNumber\nType of Device\n(1)\nMinor Hazard —\nResidential Partial\nFlow-\nThrough System\nMinor Hazard — Class\n1System\nModerate Hazard —\nClass1,2,3and\n6Syst\nems\nSevere Hazard —\nAny Class of System\nin which Antifreeze\nor Other Additives\nAre Used\nCSA B64.6.1DuCF\nP NPNPNP\nCSA B64.9SCVAF\nPPNPNP\nCSA B64.5.1DCVAF\nPPPNP\nCSA B64.4.1\nRPFPPPP\nNotes to Table A-2.6.2.4.(2):\n(1)\nThe “F” indicates that the product is only recommended for use on fire sprinkler and standpipe systems.\n(2)\nNP = not permitted and P = permitted.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-123\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-2.6.2.4.(3)Division B\nA-2.6.2.4.(3)  Fire Department Pumper Connection and Backflow Protection.\nshut-off valve\nfire department\npumper connection\nfire sprinkler/standpipe riser\nalarm check \nor flow switch\nshut-off valve\ndouble check-valve assembly \nwith indicating-type control valves\nfire service pipe\nExample of a Class 1 fire sprinkler/standpipe system constructed of \nnon-potable water system materials with no antifreeze or other additives\nmunicipal water \nsupply\nEG02007A\nFigure A-2.6.2.4.(3)\nFire department pumper connection and backflow protection\nA-2.6.2.6.(1)  Locations Requiring Premise Isolation.The following list is a guide to locations\nwhere premise isolation may be required:\n• hospital buildings with operating, mortuary or laboratory facilities\n• radioactive material processing plants\n• petroleum processing facilities\n• premises where inspection is restricted\n• sewage treatment plants\n• commercial laundries (excluding laundromats)\n• plating or chemical plants\n• docks and dockside facilities\n• food and beverage processing plants\n• steam plants\n• trackside facilities for trains\nAn assessment of the hazard must be carried out to determine the need, if any, for a backflow prevention device.\nA-2.6.2.9.(2)  Installation of Air Gaps.\nflood level rim\nair gap\ncontrol valve\nEG01176A\nwater supply\nFigure A-2.6.2.9.(2)\nInstallation of air gaps\n2-124  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.6.3.1.(2)\nA-2.6.2.10.(2)  Installation of Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers.\nheight of atmospheric\nvacuum breaker\ncontrol valve\noutlet of atmospheric vacuum\nbreaker (critical level, unless \nmarked otherwise by the\nmanufacturer)\ntank\noutlet\nflood level rim\noverflow\nindirect\nconnection\n(1)\nEG01177A\nFigure A-2.6.2.10.(2)\nInstallation of atmospheric vacuum breakers\nNote to Figure A-2.6.2.10.(2):\n(1) See Sentence 2.3.3.11.(1).\nA-2.6.3.  Water Systems.Subsection 2.6.3. contains performance requirements for water systems. Two\nwidely used references for the design of water systems are:\nNIST Building Materials and Structures Report BMS 79,“Water-Distributing Systems for Buildings,” United\nStates Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., and\nMcGraw-Hill 2009, “International Plumbing Codes Handbook,” edited by V.T. Manas, McGraw-Hill Book\nCompany, New York, U.S.A.\nA-2.6.3.1.  Water Quality.Water destined for use as potable water can originate from a variety of sources\nthat are generally classified as surface waters or well waters, such as lakes, rivers, streams and aquifers. In\nsome localities, there may be seasona\nl variations in the water supply, and surface and well waters may be\nblended at times.\nWater composition is the primary consideration in determining the cause of corrosion in potable water systems.\nIf the water has corrosive characteristics, water treatment may be necessary to control its corrosiveness: this\nmay be as straightforward as adjusting the pH of the water at the treatment plant, or it may involve more\nextensive corrosion-control treatment methods. Water purveyors normally consult treatment specialists to\ndevelop methods suitable for specific conditions. The treatment of water from private wells may also require\nexpert consultation.\nThe past performance of plumbing materials and products in different localities often provides insight into\nwhat can be expected with new installations. In areas where water-related corrosion is known to occur,\nadjustment of water chemistry may be sufficient or it may be necessary to select alternative piping and fitting\nmaterials or more robust products.\nIt is important to note that not all corrosion can be attributed to water conditions: the improper design and\ninstallation of potable water systems may result in erosion corrosion, galvanic corrosion, fatigue cracking,\nand so forth.\nA-2.6.3.1.(2)  Potable Water Systems.The design procedures contained in the following documents\nare considered good engineering practice in the field of potable water systems:\n(a) ASHRAE 2011, “ASHRAE Handbook – HVAC Applications,” chapter on Service Water Heating,\n(b) ASHRAE 2013, “ASHRAE Handbook – Fundamentals,” chapter on Pipe Sizing,\n(c) ASPE 2010, “Plumbing Engineering Design Handbook, Volume 2,”chapter on Cold Water Systems, and\n(d) ASPE 2010, “Plumbing Engineering Design Handbook, Volume 2,” chapter on Domestic Water Heating\nSystems.\nAlternatively, the following methods, which apply toboth public and private water supplies, may be used in\ndetermining the size of each section of the water system using Table A-2.6.3.1.(2)-A (Small Building Method)\nand Table A-2.6.3.1.(2)-F (Average Pressure Loss Method).

Non-Potable Water System Design.There is a growing interest in Canada in using\navailable non-potable water supplies in the place of potable ones for selected purposes such as flushing water\nclosets and irrigating lawns and gardens. Article 2.7.1.1.applies to non-potable water systems, regardless of the\norigin of the water. The non-potable water must meet applicable water quality standards as determined by an\nauthority having jurisdiction.\nA-2.7.1.1.(1)  Good Engineering Practice.Examples of good engineering practice in the design,\nfabrication and installation of non-potable water systems can be found in\n• the ASHRAE Handbooks,\n• the ASPE Handbooks, and\n• CAN/CSA-B128.1, “Design and Installation of Non-Potable Water Systems.”\nA-2.7.2.1.(1)  Aboveground Roof Surfaces.Whileitispossibletoharvestrainwaterfromsurfaces\nother than above-ground roofs, such as patios, lawns, gardens, driveways, roadways, parking garages and\nparking lots, these surfaces are not suitable catchments for rainwater harvesting systems because of water\nquality concerns. Water collected from such surfaces may be contaminated with fertilizer, herbicides, fecal\nmatter, garbage, oil or chemicals.\n2-138  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.7.2.4.(1)\nThe outdoor environment in the local area of the building site, including its immediate surroundings, should be\ninvestigated to identify contaminants that could adversely affect the quality of the non-potable water delivered\nby the rainwater harvesting system. Contaminants of concern include industrial and urban traffic emissions,\nand pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. Other factors that can influence the levels of contaminants in\nthe delivered non-potable water include the building'sgeometry, and prevailing winds and seasonal activity in\nthe local area. Design features should be incorporated in the rainwater harvesting system to mitigate the risks\nassociated with any identified contaminants of concern.\nA-2.7.2.2.(1) and 2.7.2.4.(3) and (4)  Treatment for Use.Harvested rainwater used in any\npermitted application must be treated appropriately for its intended end use.\nA-2.7.2.3.(1)  Pedestrian Traffic.The prohibition of pedestrian traffic on roof surfaces stated in\nSentence 2.7.2.3.(1) is not intended to include access to roof surfaces by service personnel, such as window\nwashers or HVAC mechanics.\nA-2.7.2.3.(2)  Roofing and Conveyance Materials.Water is considered to be the “universal solvent.”\nAccordingly, roofing components and conveyance systems that supply rainwater to a rainwater harvesting\nsystem should be constructed of materials that resistdissolution in water.

Documentation of Alternative Solutions.Beyond the purposes of demonstrating\ncompliance and acquiring an installation permit, there are other important reasons for requiring that the\nproponent of an alternative solution submit project documentation (i.e. a compliance report) to the authority\nhaving jurisdiction and for the authority having jurisdiction to retain that documentation for a substantial\nperiod following the installation of a plumbing system:\n• Most jurisdictions require that a plumbing system be maintained in compliance with the codes under\nwhich it was installed. Alternative solutions made possible by objective-based codes may have special\nmaintenance requirements, which would be described in the documentation.\n• Documentation helps consultants perform code compliance assessments of existing buildings or facilities\nbefore they are sold and informs current owners or prospective buyers of existing buildings or facilities of\nany limitations pertaining to their future use or development.\n• Documentation provides design professionals with the basic information necessary to design changes to\nan existing plumbing system.\n• An alternative solution could be invalidated by aproposed alteration to a plumbing system. Designers\nand regulators must therefore know the details of the particular alternative solutions that were integral to\nthe original design. Complete documentation should provide insight as to why one alternative solution\nwas chosen over another.\n• Documentation is the “paper trail” of the alternative solution negotiated between the designer and the\nregulator and should demonstrate that a rational process led to the acceptance of the alternative solution\nas an equivalency.\n• It is possible that over time a particular alternative solution may be shown to be inadequate. It would be\nadvantageous for a jurisdiction to know which plumbing systems included that alternative solution as\npart of their design: documentation will facilitate this type of analysis.\n• Project documentation provides important information to a forensic team that is called to investigate an\naccident or why a design failed to provide the level of performance expected.\nThis subject is discussed in further detail in “Recommended Documentation Requirements for Projects Using\nAlternative Solutions in the Context of Objective-Based Codes,” which was prepared for the CCBFC Task\nGroup on Implementation of Objective-Based Codes and is available on the NRC's website.\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements.

      "content": "The NPC is a model code in the sense that it helps promote consistency among provincial\nand territorial plumbing codes. Persons involved in the design or installation of plumbing\nsystems should consult the provincial or territorial jurisdiction concerned to find out which\nplumbing code is applicable.\nThis edition of the NPC succeeds the 2015 edition.\nDevelopment of the National Model Codes\nThe CCBFC, an independent committee established by the National Resea\nrch Council of\nCanada (NRC), is responsible for the content of the National Model Codes. The CCBFC\nis made up of volunteers from across the country and from all facets of the Codes-user\ncommunity. Members of the CCBFC and its standing committees include\nbuilders, engineers,\nskilled trade workers, architects, building owners, building operators, fire and building\nofficials, manufacturers, and representatives of general interests.\nThe CCBFC is\nadvised on scope, policy and technical issues pertaining to the Codes by the\nProvincial/Territorial Policy Advisory Committee on Codes (PTPACC), which is a committee\nof senior representatives from provincial/territorial ministries responsible for building,\nfire, plum\nbing, and energy regulation in their jurisdictions. The PTPACC was created by\nthe provinces and territories, with provision of guidance to the CCBFC as one of its main\nfunctions. Through the PTPACC, the provinces and territories are engaged in every phase of\nthe Codes d\nevelopment process.\nCodes Canada staff within the Construction Research Centre at the NRC provide technical\nand administrative support to the CCBFC and its standing committees, and coordinate the\nprovision of evidence-based research to inform Codes development. The NRC publishes the\nNational Model Codes and periodic revisions to the Codes to address pressing issues.\nThe broader Codes-user community also makes significant contributions to the Codes\ndevelopment process by submitting requests for changes or additions to the Codes and by\ncommenting on the proposed changes during the public reviews that precede each new\nedition.\nThe CCBFC takes into consideration the advice received from the provinces and territories as\nwell as Codes users' comments at each stage of Codes development. The scope and content of\nthe National Model Codes are determined on a consensus basis, which involves the review of\ntechnical, policy and practical concerns and discussion of the implications of these concerns.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020v\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nMore information on the Codes development process is available on the NRC's website.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\nThe NPC sets out technical provisions for the design and installation of new plumbing\nsystems. It also applies to the extension, alteration, renewal and repair of existing plumbing\nsystems.\nThe NPC establishes requirements to address the following four objectives:\n•safety\n• health\n• protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage\n• environment\nCode provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings and facilities\nthat might be considered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive\nconsensus process used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see\nthe section\nentitled Development of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided\nwhich characteristics should be regulated through the NPC.\nThe provisions of the NPC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required\nto adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they\nare adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become\nminimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required\nto achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority.\nThe NPC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory, becomes\na regulation. It is not a guideline on plumbing system design or installation. The design of a\ntechnically sound plumbing system depends upon many factors beyond compliance with\nplumbing regulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners\nwho have received appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar\nwith the principles of good plumbing practice and experience using reference manuals and\ntechnical guides.\nThe NPC does not list acceptable proprietary plumbing products. It establishes the criteria\nthat plumbing materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are\nexplicitly stated in the NPC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product\nstandards published by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the\nstandards related to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NPC.\nCode Requirements\nMost NPC requirements address at least one ofthe Code's four stated objectives (safety,\nhealth, protection of the building or facility from water and sewage damage, and\nenvironment).\nIn processing proposed changes or additions to any of the National Model C\nodes, the\nCCBFC considers many issues such as the following:\n• Does the proposed requirement provide the minimum level of performance—and\nno more than the minimum—needed to achieve the Code's objectives?\n• Will persons responsible for Code compliance be able to act on or implement the\nrequirement using commonly accepted practices?\n• Will enforcement agencies be able to enforce the requirement?\n• Are the costs of implementing the requirement justifiable?\n• Have the potential policy implications of the requirement been identified and\naddressed?\n• Is there broad consensus on this requirement among Code users representing all\nfacets of the plumbing system design and construction industries, as well as among\nprovincial and territorial governments?\nGuidelines for requesting changes to the NPC are available on the NRC's website.\nviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nObjective-Based Code Format\nThe NPC has been published in an objective-based code format since 2005.\nAs described in more detail in the section entitled Structure of the NPC, the Code comprises\nthree Divisions:\n• Division A, which defines the scope of the Code and contains the objectives, the\nfunctional statements and the conditions necessary to achieve compliance;\n• Division B, which contains acceptable solutions (commonly referred to as “tech\nnical\nrequirements”) deemed to satisfy the objectives and functional statements listed in\nDivision A; and\n• Division C, which contains administrative provisions.\nMostoftherequirementsinDivisionBarelinkedtothreetypesofinformation:\n• objectives (Code objectives, such as safety or health, which individual requirements\nhelp to address),\n• functional statements (statements of the functions of the plumbing system that a\nparticular requirement helps to achieve), and\n• intent statements (detailed statements of the specific intent of the requirement).\nObjectives\nThe NPC's objectives are fully defined in Section 2.2. of Division A.\nThe objectives describe, in broad terms, the overall goals that the NPC's requirements are\nintended to achieve. They serve to define the boundaries of the subject areas the Code\naddresses. However,\nthe Code does not address all the issues that might be considered\nto fall within those boundaries.\nThe objectives describe undesirable situations and their consequences, which the Code\naims to prevent from occurring in plumbing systems. The wording of most of the\ndefinitions of the objectives includes two key phrases: “limit the probability” and\n“unacceptable risk.” The phrase “limit the probability” is used to acknowledge that the\nNPC cannot entirely prevent those undesirable situations from happening. The phrase\n“unacceptable risk” acknowledges that the NPC cannot eliminate all risk: the “acceptable\nrisk” is the risk remaining once compliance with the Code has been achieved.\nThe objectives are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be used on their own in the\ndesign and approval processes.\nThe objectives attributed to the requirements or portions of requirements in Division B\narelistedinatableinSection2.8.ofDivisionB.\nFunctional Statements\nThe NPC's functional statements are defined in Section 3.2. of Division A.\nThe functional statements are more detailed than the objectives. They describe conditions\nin the plumbing system that help satisfy the objectives. The functional statements and the\nobjectives are interconnected. There may be several functional statements related to any\none objective, and a given functional statement may describe a function of the plumbing\nsystem that serves to achieve more than one objective.\nLike objectives, functional statements are entirely qualitative and are not intended to be\nused on their own in the design and approval processes.\nThe functional statements attributed to the requirements or portions of requirement\nsin\nDivision B are listed in a table in Section 2.8. of Division B.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020vii\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nIntent Statements\nIntent statements explain the basic th\ninking behind each Code provision contained in\nDivision B. Intent statements, each of which is unique to the provision with which it is\nassociated, explain how requirements help to achieve their attributed objectives and\nfunctional statements. Like the obje\nctives, the intent statements are expressed in terms\nof risk avoidance and expected performance. They offer insight into the views of the\nresponsible standing committee on what the Code provisions are intended to achieve.\nThe intent statements serve explanatory purposes only and do not form an integral part of\nthe Code provisions. As such, they are similar in function to the explanatory Notes at the\nend of each Part. Due to the sheer volume of intent statements—hundreds for the NPC\nalone—they are made available as a separate electronic document entitled “Supplement\nto the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is posted on the NRC's website.\nAll this additional information—objectives, functional statements and intent statements—is\nintended to facilitate the implementation of the Code in two ways:\n• Clarity of intent: The objectives, functional statements andintent statements\nlinked\nto a Code requirement clarify the reasoning behind that requirement and facilitate\nunderstanding of what must be done to satisfy that requirement. This added information\nmay also help avoid disputes between practitioners and officials over these ty\npes\nof issues.\n• Flexibility: The additional information allows for flexibility in Code compliance. A\nperson seeking to propose a new method or material not described or covered in th\ne\nCode will be able to use the added information to understand the expected level of\nperformance that their alternative solution must achieve to satisfy the Code.\nStructure of the NPC\nThe NPC is organized into three Divisions.\nDivision A: Compliance, Objectives and Functional Statements\nDivision A defines the scope of the NPC and presents the objectives that the Code\naddresses and the functions the plumbing system must perform to help to satisfy those\nobjectives.\nDivision A cannot be used on its own as a basis for designing and installing a plumbing\nsystem or for evaluating a plumbing system's compliance with the Code.\nDivision B: Acceptable Solutions\nThe term “acceptable solutions” refers to the technical requirements contained in the\nCode. It reflects the principle that plumbing codes establish an acceptable level of risk\nor performance and underlines the fact that a code cannot describe all possible valid\ndesign and installation options. Acceptable solutions represent the minimum level of\nperformance that will satisfy the NPC's objectives and that is acceptable to an authority\nthat adopts the NPC into law or regulation.\nMost of the requirements in Division B—the acceptable solutions—are linked to at least\none objective and functional statement found in Division A. These linkages play an\nimportant role in allowing objective-based codes to accommodate innovation.\nIt is expected that the majority of Code users will primarily follow the acceptable\nsolutions presented in Division B and that they will consult Division A only when seeking\nclarification on the application of Division B's requirements to a particular situation,\nwhen considering an alternative solution, or when looking up the definition of selected\nterms in the context of the NPC.\nviiiNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nDivision C: Administrative Provisions\nDivision C contains administrative provisions relating to the application of the Code.\nMany provinces and territories establish their own administrative provisions upon\nadopting or adapting the NPC; having all the administrative provisions in one Division\nfacilitates their customization to suit jurisdictional needs.\nIn addition, a separate document entitled Administrative Requirements for Use with\nthe National Building Code of Canada 1985 is automatically adopted, in accordance\nwith Article 2.2.1.1. of Division C, if the authority having jurisdiction does not provide\nother administrative requirements.\nRelationship between Division A and Division B\nSentence 1.2.1.1.(1) of Division A is a very important sentence: it is a precise statement of\nthe relationship between Divisions A and B and is central to the concept of objective-based\ncodes.\n1)Compliance with this Code shall be achieved by\na)  complying with the applicable acceptable solutions in Division B (see Note\nA-1.2.1.1.(1)(a)), or\nb)  using alternative solutions that will achieve at least the minimum level of\nperformance required by Division B in the areas defined by the objectives\nand functional statements attributed tothe applicable acceptable solutions\n(see Note A-1.2.1.1.(1)(b)).\nClause (a) makes it clear that the acceptable solutions in Division B are automatically\ndeemed to satisfy the linked objectives and functional statements of Division A.\nClause (b) makes it clear that alternative solutions can be used in lieu of compliance\nwith the acceptable solutions. However, todo something different from the acceptable\nsolutions described in Division B, a proponent must show that their proposed alternative\nsolution will perform at least as well as the acceptable solution(s) it is replacing. The\nobjectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solution(s) identify the\nareas of performance where this equivalence must be demonstrated.\nAdditional Information\nNumbering System\nA consistent numbering system has been used throughout the National Model Codes. The\nfirst number indicates the Part of the Code; the second, the Section in the Part; the third,\nthe Subsection; and the fourth, the Article in the Subsection. The detailed provisions are\nfound at the Sentence level (indicated by numbers in brackets), and Sentences may be\nbroken down into Clauses and Subclauses. This structure is illustrated as follows:\n3Part\n3.5.\nSection\n3.5.2.\nSubsection\n3.5.2.1.\nArticle\n3.5.2.1.(2)\nSentence\n3.5.2.1.(2)(a)\nClause\n3.5.2.1.(2)(a)(i)\nSubclause\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020ix\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nMeaning of the Words “And” and “Or” between the Clauses and Subclauses\nof a Sentence\nMultiple Clauses and Subclauses are connected by the word “and” or “or” at the end of\nthe second last Clause or Subclause in the series. Although this connecting word appears\nonly once, it is meant to apply to all the preceding Clauses or Subclauses within that series.\nFor example, in a series of five Clauses—(a) to (e)—in a Sentence, the appearance of the\nword “and” at the end of Clause (d) means that all Clauses in the Sentence are connected\nto each other with the word “and.” Similarly, in a series of five Clauses—(a) to (e)—in a\nSentence, the appearance of the word “or” at the end of Clause (d) means that all Clauses\nin the Sentence are connected to each other with the word “or.”\nIn all cases, it is important to note that a Clause (and its Subclauses, if any) must always\nbe read in conjunction with its introductory text appearing at the beginning of the\nSentence. Moreover, the connecting words “and” and “or” must be read in the context\nof the Sentence. In particular, the use of the word “and” as a connecting word does not\nnecessarily mean that all Clauses (or Subclauses) are applicable for compliance with\nthe Sentence.\nChange Indication\nAs a courtesy to Code users, efforts have been made to identify technical changes relative\nto the 2015 edition. Where a technical addition or revision has been made, a vertical line\nhas been added in the margin next to the affected provision to indicate the approximate\nlocation of the new or revised content. No change indication is provided for editorial\nrevisions or for renumbered or deleted content.\nUnits\nAll values in the NPC, other than nominal pipe sizes, are given in metric units. Some of\nthe metric values in the Code have been converted and rounded from imperial values. A\nconversion table of imperial equivalents for the most common units used in plumbing\nsystem design and installation is located at the end of the Code.\nComplementary Publications\nThe following publications are referenced in the NPC 2020 or facilitate the application\nof its requirements:\nNational Building Code of Canada 2020\nSupplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements\nThese and other Code documents published by the NRC are made available in free\nelectronic format on the NRC's website.\nCommercial Reproduction\nCopyright for the NPC is owned by the NRC.

Activities of the NSS are coordinated by the Standards Council of\nCanada (SCC), which accredits standards development organizations, certification bodies,\ntesting and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, among others.\nThe SCC is a non-profit federal Crown corporation responsible for the coordination of\nvoluntary standardization in Canada. It also coordinates Canadian participation in voluntary\ninternational standardization activities.\nCanadian Standards\nMany of the standards referenced in the NPC are published by standards development\norganizations accredited in Canada. As part of the accreditation requirements, these\norganizations adhere to the principle of consensus, which generally means substantial\nmajority agreement of a committee comprising a balance of producer, user and general\ninterest members, and the consideration of all negative comments. The standards\ndevelopment organizations also have formal procedures for the balloting and second-level\nreview of standards prepared under their oversight.\nThe following organizations are accredited as standards development organizations in\nCanada:\n• Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI)\n• ASTM International\n• Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ)\n• Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB)\n•CSAGroup\n• International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO)\n•ULCStandards\n• Underwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL)\nTable 1.3.1.2. of Division B lists the standards referenced in the NPC. Standards proposed to\nbe referenced in the NPC are reviewed to ensure that their content is compatible with the\nCode. Thereafter, referenced standards are reviewed as needed during each Code cycle.\nStandards development organizations are asked to provide information on any changes in the\nstatus of their standards referenced in the NPC—withdrawals, amendments, new editions,\netc. This information is passed on to the CCBFC, its standing committees, the provinces and\nterritories, and interested stakeholders, all of whom are given the opportunity to identify\nany problems associated with the changes. These bodies do not necessarily review in detail\nthe revised standards; rather, the approach relies on the consensus process involved in the\nmaintenance of the standards and on the extensive knowledge and experience of committee\nmembers, provincial or territorial staff, NRC staff, and consulted stakeholders to identify\nchanges in the standards that might create problems in the Code.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xiii\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nNon-Canadian Standards\nA number of subject areas for which the standards development organizations accredited in\nCanada have not developed standards are covered in the NPC. In these cases, the Code often\nreferences standards develop\ned by organizations in other countries, such as the American\nSociety of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the\nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA). These standards are developed using processes\nthat may differ from those use\nd by the standards development organizations accredited in\nCanada; nevertheless, the standards have been reviewed by the relevant standing committees\nand found to be acceptable.\nConformity Assessment\nThe NPC establishes minimum measures, which are set out within its own text or within\nreferenced standards. However, the NPC does not set out who is responsible for assessing\nconformity to the measures or how those with this responsibility might carry it out. This\nresponsibility is usually established by the governing legislation of the adopting provinces\nand territories. Provincial or territorial authorities should be consulted to determine who is\nresponsible for conformity assessment within their jurisdiction.\nThose persons responsible for ensuring that materials, appliances, systems and equipment\nmeet the requirements of this Code have several means avai\nlable to assist them, ranging\nfrom on-site inspection to the use of certification services provided by accredited third-party\norganizations. Test reports or mill certificates provided by manufacturers or suppliers can\nalso assist in the acceptance of products. Engineering r\neports may be required for more\ncomplex products.\nTesting\nThe SCC accredits testing and calibration laboratories that are capable of reliably testing\nproducts to specified standards. The test results produced by these organizations can be\nused in the certification, evaluation and qualification of products for compliance with\nCode provisions. The SCC's website (www.scc.ca) lists accredited testing and calibration\nlaboratories, along with their scope of accreditation.\nCertification\nCertification is the confirmation by an independent organization that a product, process,\nservice or system meets a requirement. Certification may entail physical examination,\ntesting as specified in appropriate standards, an initial plant inspection, and/\nor follow-up\nunannounced plant inspections. This procedure leads to the issuing of a formal assurance\nor declaration, by means of a certification mark or certificate, that the product, process,\nservice or system is in full conformity with specified provisions.\nIn some cases, a product for which no standard exists can be certified using procedures\nand criteria developed by an accredited certification body and specifically designed to\nmeasure the performance of that product.\nCertification bodies publish lists of certified products and companies. The SCC's website\n(www.scc.ca) lists accredited certification bodies, along with their scope of accreditation.\nSeveral organizations, including the Canadian Construction Materials Centre (CCMC) at\nthe NRC, offer product certification services.\nEvaluation\nAn evaluation is a written opinion by an independent professional organization that a\nproduct will perform its intended function. An evaluation is often done to determine the\nability of an innovative product, for which no standards exist, to satisfy the intent of a\nCode requirement. Follow-up plant inspections are not normally part of the evaluation\nprocess.\nxivNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nPreface\nQualification\nQualification evaluates the ability of a product to perform its intended function by\nverifying that it meets the requirements of a standard. Qualification normally includes\nsome follow-up plant inspection. Some organizations publish lists of qualified products\nthat meet the specified requirements. Some organizations qualify product manufacturing\nand/or testing facilities for compliance with the Code and relevant standards.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020xv\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nxviNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nCanadian Commission on Building and\nFire Codes and Standing Committees\nCanadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes\nD.

In fact, if it can be determined that a design meets all the applicable acceptable\nsolutions in Division B, there is no need to consult the objectives and functional statements in Division A to\ndetermine its compliance.\nA-1.2.1.1.(1)(b)  Code Compliance via Alternative Solutions.Where a design differs from the\nacceptable solutions in Division B, then it should be treated as an “alternative solution.” A proponent of an\nalternative solution must demonstrate that the alternative solution addresses the same issues as the applicable\nacceptable solutions in Division B and their attributed objectives and functional statements. However, because\nthe objectives and functional statements are entirelyqualitative, demonstrating compliance with them in\nisolation is not possible. Therefore, Clause 1.2.1.1.(1)(b) identifies the principle that Division B establishes the\nquantitative performance targets that alternative solutions must meet. In many cases, these targets are not\ndefined very precisely by the acceptable solutions—certainly far less precisely than would be the case with\na true performance code, which would have quantitative performance targets and prescribed methods of\nperformance measurement for all aspects of building performance. Nevertheless, Clause 1.2.1.1.(1)(b) makes it\nclear that an effort must be made to demonstrate that analternative solution will perform as well as a design\nthat would satisfy the applicable acceptable solutions in Division B—not “well enough” but “as well as.”\nIn this sense, it is Division B that defines the boundaries between acceptable risks and the “unacceptable” risks\nreferred to in the statements of the Code's objectives, i.e., the risk remaining once the applicable acceptable\nsolutions in Division B have been implemented represents the residual level of risk deemed to be acceptable by\nthe broad base of Canadians who have taken part in the consensus process used to develop the Code.\nLevel of Performance\nWhere Division B offers a choice between several possible designs, it is likely that these designs may\nnot all provide exactly the same level of performance. Among a number of possible designs satisfying\nacceptable solutions in Division B, the design providing the lowest level of performance should generally\nbe considered to establish the minimum acceptable level of performance to be used in evaluating alternative\nsolutions for compliance with the Code.\nSometimes a single design will be used as an alternative solution to several sets of acceptable solutions\nin Division B. In this case, the level of performance required of the alternative solution should be at least\nequivalent to the overall level of performance established by all the applicable sets of acceptable solutions\ntaken as a whole.\nEach provision in Division B has been analyzed to determine what it is intended to achieve. The resultant\nintent statements clarify what undesirable results each provision seeks to preclude. These statements\nare not a legal component of the Code, but are advisory in nature, and can help Code users establish\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements. The number\nthat introduces each Note corresponds to the applicable requirement in this Part.\nThe figures are schematic only; they depict various parts of the plumbing system but do not include details. For an\nexplanation of the symbols and abbreviations used in the figures, refer to the list provided at the end of the Code.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division A  1-11\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)Division A\nperformance targets for alternative solutions. They are published as a separate electronic document entitled\n“Supplement to the NPC 2020: Intent Statements,” which is available on the NRC's website.\nAreas of Performance\nA subset of the acceptable solutions in Division B may establish criteria for particular types of designs (e.g.,\ncertain types of materials, components, assemblies, or systems). Often such subsets of acceptable solutions\nare all attributed to the same objective: OH2, Sanitation, for example. In some cases, the designs that are\nnormally used to satisfy this subset of acceptable solutions might also provide some benefits that could be\nrelated to some other objective: OP5, Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage,\nfor example. However, if none of the applicable acceptable solutions are linked to Objective OP5, it is not\nnecessary that alternative solutions proposed to replace these acceptable solutions provide a similar benefit\nrelated to Protection of the Building or Facility from Water and Sewage Damage. In other words, the\nacceptable solutions in Division B establish acceptable levels of performance for compliance with the Code\nonly in those areas defined by the objectives and functional statements attributed to the acceptable solutions.\nApplicable Acceptable Solutions\nIn demonstrating that an alternative solution will perform as well as a design that would satisfy the\napplicable acceptable solutions in Division B, its evaluation should not be limited to comparison with the\nacceptable solutions to which an alternative is proposed. It is possible that acceptable solutions elsewhere\nin the Code also apply. The proposed alternative solution may be shown to perform as well as the most\napparent acceptable solution, which it is replacing, but may not perform as well as other relevant acceptable\nsolutions. For example, an innovative piping material may perform adequately in a drainage system, but\nmay not meet combustibility requirements elsewhere in the Code. All applicable acceptable solutions\nshould be taken into consideration in demonstrating the compliance of an alternative solution.\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)  Defined Terms.\nAuxiliary Water Supply\nThe auxiliary water supply may include water from a secondary potable water supply or from any natural\nsource, such as a well, lake, spring, stream or harbour. It may also include waste water (but not sanitary\ndrainage) from industrial processes, such as cooling towers, or from storm retention ponds. These sources\nmay be polluted or contaminated and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the primary\nwater purveyor does not have sanitary control. It is generally accepted that there are two categories of\nauxiliary water supply:\n(a) any public potable water supply over which the primary water purveyor does not have sanitary\ncontrol, or\n(b) any private water supply, other than the primary potable water supply, that is on or available to the\npremises.\nClass 3 Fire Sprinkler/Standpipe Systems\nIn Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems, water is supplied to the storage facilities from the public water\nsupply and is maintained in potable condition. Class 3 fire sprinkler/standpipe systems resemble Class 1\nfire sprinkler/standpipe systems in all other respects.\nClear-Water Waste\nExamples of clear-water waste are the waste waters discharged from a drinking fountain, cooling jacket, air\nconditioner or relief valve outlet.\nEmergency Floor Drains\nThere are two types of floor drains. One is an emergency floor drain installed to avoid flooding in a\nbuilding from any pipe or fixture failure. The other encompasses floor drains installed to receive discharge\nfrom specific pieces of equipment; this type is defined as a fixture.\n1-12  Division ANational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision AA-1.4.1.2.(1)\nIllustrations for Defined Terms\nNormal flow conditions\nBackflow conditions\nleakage port\n(a) Reduced pressure principle backflow\npreventer assembly\ninlet\nwater supply pipe\nvalve\ncheck valve\nleakage port\nvalve\ncheck valve\nE G 01117 A\ndifferential relief valve\nAssembly of differential valves and\ncheck valves used as a backflow preventer\n(b)\nFigure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-A\nBackflow preventer\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division A  1-13\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-1.4.1.2.(1)Division A\nsink or lavatory\nflood level rim\nbathtub\nflush valve water closet\nflood level rim\nflood level rim\nE G 01118 A\nFigure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B\nBack-siphonage\nNotes to Figure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B:\n(1) Figure A-1.4.1.2.(1)-B shows a situation that is fairly common in old buildings.

PVC cement shall be grey, ABS cement shall be yellow, CPVC cement shall be clear and transition\ncement shall be white. The standard colour allows Code users to readily determine if the correct solvent cement\nhas been used. It should be noted that a transition cement is not an all-purpose cement.\nA-2.2.5.12.(1)  Polyethylene/Aluminum/Polyethylene Composite Pipe and Fittings.There\nare some special installation requirements for the use of polyethylene/aluminum/polyeth\nylene composite\npipe and fittings.

Reference should, therefore, be made to the installation information\nin CSA B137.11, “Polypropylene (PP-R) pipeand fittings for pressure applications.”\nA-2.2.5.15.(1)  Polyethylene of Raised Temperature Tube.It should be noted that CSA B137.18,\n“Polyethylene of raised temperature resistance (PE-RT) tubing systems for pressureapplications,” contains\nspecial installation requirements, which should be followed.\nA-2.2.6.7.(3)  Galvanized Steel Pipe.The use of galvanized steel pipe and fittings in a water\ndistribution system may have proven acceptable on the basis of past performance in some localities and\nits acceptance under this Code may be warranted.\nA-2.2.10.5.(1)  Saddle Hubs or Fittings.Saddle hubs or fittings may have proven acceptable on the\nbasis of past performance in some localities and their acceptance under this Code may be warranted.\nA-2.2.10.6.(2)  Supply Fittings and Individual Shower Heads.Flow restriction devices within\nsupply fittings should not be removed.\nDue to the low flow rate of public lavatory faucets, design consideration should be given to the wait time for\nhot water to be delivered to each fixture.\nA-2.2.10.6.(3)  Automatic Compensating Valves.When replacing a shower head, the appropriate\nshower\nvalve with a suitable compensating feature matching the flow rate should be chosen to decrease\nthe possibility that users will suffer thermal shock. The water flow rate of automatic compensating mixing\nvalves can be found in ASSE 1016/ASME A112.1016/CSA B125.16, “Performance Requirements for Automatic\nCompen\nsating Valves for Individual Showers and Tub/Shower Combinations.”\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-79\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-2.2.10.6.(4) and (5)Division B\nA-2.2.10.6.(4) and (5)  Automatic Shut-off of Water Flow.Examples of water shut-off devices\ninclude occupant sensors and self-closing valves.\nA-2.2.10.6.(7)  Manually Operated Valves.Manually operated valves are also known in the industry\nas supply line stops.\nA-2.2.10.7.  Hot Water Temperature.Hot water delivered at 60°C, a typical thermostat setting for\nstorage-type service water heaters, will severely burn human skin in 1 to 5 s. Consequently, Article 2.2.10.7.\nsets an upper limit on the temperature of water discharging from shower heads and into bathtubs. The\nwater temperature is maintained at or below this limitthrough the installation and adjustment of automatic\ncompensating valves or temperature-limiting devices. Compliance with the Article reduces the risk of scalding\nin showers and bathtubs, which could result in severe burns, and the risk of thermal shock in showers, which\ncould lead to falls. Children, older adults and people with disabilities are particularly at risk of scalding because\nthey are not always able to remove themselves quickly from a shower or bathtub if the water becomes too hot.\nAtawatertemperatureof49°C,thetimeforascaldburntooccuronanadultisnearly10min,whereasthe\ntime for a scald burn to occur on an older adult is only 2 min because their skin is thinner and less vascularized.\nAt a water temperature of 43°C, scald burns occur only after several hours of exposure. Therefore, setting 43°C\nas the maximum temperature for water discharging from shower heads and into bathtubs provides suitable\nprotection from scald burns in healthcare facilities and seniors' residences.\nAlthough the temperature of water discharging into otherfixtures, such as lavatories, sinks, laundry trays and\nbidets, is not addressed by Article 2.2.10.7., a risk of scalding may nonetheless exist at such fixtures.\nIt should be noted that pressure-balanced valves are sensitive to seasonal changes in the temperature of the\ncold water supply and may require adjustments throughout the year to avoid exceeding the maximum water\ntemperature prescribed in Article 2.2.10.7.\nA-2.2.10.9.(3)  Bubblers.Bubblers installed on other than drinking fountains may have proven acceptable\non the basis of past performance in some localities and their acceptance under this Code may be warranted.\nA-2.2.10.16.(1)  Air Admittance Valve.An air admittance valve is a device that is closed by gravity\nand seals the vent terminal at zero differential pressure (no flow conditions) and under positive internal\npressures. The valve allows air to enter the drainage system without the use of a vent extended to outside air\nand prevents trap siphonage.\nThe material of the diaphragm can be damaged by exposure to acidic or corrosive fumes in the ambient\natmosphere; therefore, air admittance valves should notbe installed in locations where there is a potential for\nexposure to such fumes.\nA-2.3.2.6.(1)  Mechanical Joints.Storm sewer blockage can cause mechanical joints at the base of\nleaders to fail, which results in flooding. The failureoccurs because the cleanout joints at the base of the\nrainwater leaders are not able to withstand the water column pressure. To avoid such failures, it is necessary\nto ensure that storm water systems installed using mechanical joints be braced and/or restrained at the\nends of branches, changes in direction and elevation, at dead ends and at other locations as required by the\nmanufacturer to prevent the separation of joints due to internal pressure, mechanical stress or seismic events.\nCare should be taken to replace cleanouts properly after maintenance or testing.\n2-80  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.3.3.11.(2)\nA-2.3.3.9.

Determination of Hydraulic Loads and Nominal Pipe Sizes of Drainage Pipes.\nHydraulic Loads\nThe hydraulic load that is imposed by a fixture is represented by a factor called a fixture unit. Fixture\nunits are dimensionless and take into account the rate of discharge, time of discharge and frequency of\ndischarge of the fixture.\nConfusion often arises when attempts are made to convert fixture units to litres per second because there is\nno straightforward relationship between the two. The proportion of the total number of fixtures that can be\nexpected to discharge simultaneously in a large system is smaller than in a small system. For example,\ndoubling the number of fixtures in a system will not double the peak flow that the system must carry,\nalthough of course the flow will be increased somewhat. Figure A-2.4.10.-A shows the relationship that\nwas used in constructing the tables ofcapacities of stacks, branches, sanitary building drains and sanitary\nbuilding sewers (Tables 2.4.10.6.-A to 2.4.10.6.-C).\nAlthough the curve in Figure A-2.4.10.-A was used to prepare the Code tables, it was not included in the\nNational Plumbing Code. Instead, a single approximate conversion factor is given in the Code so that\na continuous flow from a fixture may be converted from litres per second to fixture units in order to\ndetermine the total hydraulic load on the sanitary drainage system. The conversion factor, which is given in\nSentence 2.4.10.3.(1), is 31.7 fixture units per litres per second.

Determination of Hydraulic Loads and Nominal Pipe Sizes of Drainage Pipes.\nHydraulic Loads\nThe hydraulic load that is imposed by a fixture is represented by a factor called a fixture unit. Fixture\nunits are dimensionless and take into account the rate of discharge, time of discharge and frequency of\ndischarge of the fixture.\nConfusion often arises when attempts are made to convert fixture units to litres per second because there is\nno straightforward relationship between the two. The proportion of the total number of fixtures that can be\nexpected to discharge simultaneously in a large system is smaller than in a small system. For example,\ndoubling the number of fixtures in a system will not double the peak flow that the system must carry,\nalthough of course the flow will be increased somewhat. Figure A-2.4.10.-A shows the relationship that\nwas used in constructing the tables ofcapacities of stacks, branches, sanitary building drains and sanitary\nbuilding sewers (Tables 2.4.10.6.-A to 2.4.10.6.-C).\nAlthough the curve in Figure A-2.4.10.-A was used to prepare the Code tables, it was not included in the\nNational Plumbing Code. Instead, a single approximate conversion factor is given in the Code so that\na continuous flow from a fixture may be converted from litres per second to fixture units in order to\ndetermine the total hydraulic load on the sanitary drainage system. The conversion factor, which is given in\nSentence 2.4.10.3.(1), is 31.7 fixture units per litres per second. The discharge from a continuous flow fixture\nin litres per second when multiplied by 31.7 gives the hydraulic load in fixture units, and that load is added\nto the fixture unit load from other fixtures to give the total load that the sanitary drainage pipe must carry.\nThe hydraulic load that is produced by storm water runoff depends both on the size of the area that\nis drained and local rainfall intensity. The capacities of storm drainage pipes and combined sewers in\nTables 2.4.10.9., 2.4.10.10. and 2.4.10.11. have been expressed in terms of the number of litres that they can\ncarry when the local rainfall intensity is 1 mm in 15 min.

Fixture stopcocks or shut-off valves located immediately adjacent to\na fixture may not be adequate to protect the water distribution piping. Where a dwelling unit is served by a\nsingle shut-off valve on the water supply, additional shut-off valves may be required to achieve compliance\nwith Sentences 2.6.1.3.(4) and (7).\nA-2.6.1.6.(5)  Flush-Tank-Type Urinals in Seasonal Buildings.Flush-tank-type urinals that are\nnot in use for an extended period of time, such as those in seasonal buildings, are permitted to be set up to\nflush automatically at predetermined intervals. Automatic flushing prevents the depletion of the water seal\ndue to evaporation or backflow conditions. The trap seal restricts the infiltration of gases, which can pose\nhealth and safety concerns.\nA-2.6.1.7.(5)  Relief Valves.If the discharge piping is longer than 2 m or more than two 90° elbows are\nused, the valve manufacturer's installation instructions should be followed to ensure that the piping does not\naffect the relief valves' discharge capacity.\n2-122  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.6.2.4.(2)\nA-2.6.1.9.(1)  Water Hammer Prevention.Waterhammerisabuildupofpressureinalengthof\nhorizontal or vertical pipe that occurs when a valve or faucet is closed suddenly. The longer the pipe and the\ngreater the water velocity, the greater the pressure exerted on the pipe, which can be many times the normal\nstatic water pressure and be sufficient to damage the piping system. Since air chambers made from a piece of\nvertical pipe do not provide acceptable protection, pre-manufactured water hammer arresters are required\nto address this potential problem. Water hammer arresters need not be installed at every valve or faucet, nor\nin every piping system.\nA-2.6.1.11.(1)  Thermal Expansion.To accommodate the increase in pressure caused by thermal\nexpansion within a closed water distribution system, one of the following should be installed:\n(1) a suitably sized diaphragm expansion tank designed for use within a potable water system,\n(2) an auxiliary thermal expansion relief valve (T.E.R.valve) conforming to CSA B125.3, “Plumbing fittings,”\nset at a pressure of 550 kPa or less and designed for repeated use, or\n(3) other means acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction.\nA-2.6.1.12.(1)  Service Water Heaters.Storing hot water at temperatures below 60°C in the hot water\ntank or in the delivery system may lead to the growth of legionella bacteria. Contemporary electric water heater\ntanks experience temperature stratification and thus tend to have legionella bacteria in the lower parts of the\ntank. Article 2.6.1.12. specifies a thermostat setting of 60°C, which addresses the concern over the growth of\nlegionella bacteria in electric hot water storage tanks and is enforceable without introducing unnecessary\ncomplications. The growth of legionella bacteria is not aconcern for other types of water heaters with different\ndesigns that use different fuels.\nElectrically heated water heaters are shipped with the thermostat set at 60°C. Article 2.6.1.12. is included in\nthe NPC to formalize this de facto temperature setting as a requirement. The thermostats have graduated\ntemperature markings to allow such a setting, whichis not the case with gas- or oil-heated water heaters.\nA-2.6.2.4.(2)  Backflow from Fire Protection Systems.The following document is considered to be\ngood engineering practice when selecting a backflow preventer for installation on a fire protection system:\nAWWA M14, “Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control.”\nTable A-2.6.2.4.(2)\nSelection Guide for Backflow Prevention Devices on Fire Sprinkler and Standpipe Systems\nSystems Made with Potable Water\nSystem Materials\n(2)\nSystems Not Made with Potable Water\nSystem Materials\n(2)\nCSA St\nandard\nNumber\nType of Device\n(1)\nMinor Hazard —\nResidential Partial\nFlow-\nThrough System\nMinor Hazard — Class\n1System\nModerate Hazard —\nClass1,2,3and\n6Syst\nems\nSevere Hazard —\nAny Class of System\nin which Antifreeze\nor Other Additives\nAre Used\nCSA B64.6.1DuCF\nP NPNPNP\nCSA B64.9SCVAF\nPPNPNP\nCSA B64.5.1DCVAF\nPPPNP\nCSA B64.4.1\nRPFPPPP\nNotes to Table A-2.6.2.4.(2):\n(1)\nThe “F” indicates that the product is only recommended for use on fire sprinkler and standpipe systems.\n(2)\nNP = not permitted and P = permitted.\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-123\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nA-2.6.2.4.(3)Division B\nA-2.6.2.4.(3)  Fire Department Pumper Connection and Backflow Protection.\nshut-off valve\nfire department\npumper connection\nfire sprinkler/standpipe riser\nalarm check\nor flow switch\nshut-off valve\ndouble check-valve assembly\nwith indicating-type control valves\nfire service pipe\nExample of a Class 1 fire sprinkler/standpipe system constructed of\nnon-potable water system materials with no antifreeze or other additives\nmunicipal water\nsupply\nEG02007A\nFigure A-2.6.2.4.(3)\nFire department pumper connection and backflow protection\nA-2.6.2.6.(1)  Locations Requiring Premise Isolation.The following list is a guide to locations\nwhere premise isolation may be required:\n• hospital buildings with operating, mortuary or laboratory facilities\n• radioactive material processing plants\n• petroleum processing facilities\n• premises where inspection is restricted\n• sewage treatment plants\n• commercial laundries (excluding laundromats)\n• plating or chemical plants\n• docks and dockside facilities\n• food and beverage processing plants\n• steam plants\n• trackside facilities for trains\nAn assessment of the hazard must be carried out to determine the need, if any, for a backflow prevention device.\nA-2.6.2.9.(2)  Installation of Air Gaps.\nflood level rim\nair gap\ncontrol valve\nEG01176A\nwater supply\nFigure A-2.6.2.9.(2)",

Water Quality.Water destined for use as potable water can originate from a variety of sources\nthat are generally classified as surface waters or well waters, such as lakes, rivers, streams and aquifers. In\nsome localities, there may be seasona\nl variations in the water supply, and surface and well waters may be\nblended at times.\nWater composition is the primary consideration in determining the cause of corrosion in potable water systems.\nIf the water has corrosive characteristics, water treatment may be necessary to control its corrosiveness: this\nmay be as straightforward as adjusting the pH of the water at the treatment plant, or it may involve more\nextensive corrosion-control treatment methods. Water purveyors normally consult treatment specialists to\ndevelop methods suitable for specific conditions. The treatment of water from private wells may also require\nexpert consultation.\nThe past performance of plumbing materials and products in different localities often provides insight into\nwhat can be expected with new installations. In areas where water-related corrosion is known to occur,\nadjustment of water chemistry may be sufficient or it may be necessary to select alternative piping and fitting\nmaterials or more robust products.\nIt is important to note that not all corrosion can be attributed to water conditions: the improper design and",

In that column, find the fixture unit value that is equal to or greater than the fixture\nunit demand at each pipe and follow the row back to the second column to locate the\nnominal pipe size of the water distribution system.\nStep 3: Cold Water Piping (see Table A-2.6.3.1.(2)-D)\n(a) Start with the most remote outlet on the cold water piping using the established total\ndeveloped length column and pressure range group in Table A-2.6.3.1.(2)-A and work\nthrough Steps 2(c), (d) and (e) for hot water piping.\n(b) Usethesumofthetotalfixtureunitvaluesgiven in Tables 2.6.3.2.-A, 2.6.3.2.-B, 2.6.3.2.-C\nand 2.6.3.2.-D and work back toward the water service entry.\n(c) Where the service water heater distribution pipe occurs, add in the fixture unit demand\nof the fixtures served only with hot water and those that have not yet been added in\nas served to the cold water side of the most remote fixtures requiring both a hot and\ncold water supply.\n(d) Continue by sizing the cold water main between the service water heater distribution\npipe and the water service entry.\n(e) Add in the fixtures served with cold water only from the main within the most remote\noccupancy as they occur and all common distribution piping serving hot and cold water\nto other occupancies as they occur.\n(f) Complete by sizing all distribution piping served by the main within the most remote\noccupancy and then the other occupancies not yet sized using the previously established\ntotal developed length and pressure range group in Table A-2.6.3.1.(2)-A.\nTable A-2.6.3.1.(2)-A\nNominal Pipe Sizes for

Non-Potable Water System Design.There is a growing interest in Canada in using\navailable non-potable water supplies in the place of potable ones for selected purposes such as flushing water\nclosets and irrigating lawns and gardens. Article 2.7.1.1.applies to non-potable water systems, regardless of the\norigin of the water. The non-potable water must meet applicable water quality standards as determined by an\nauthority having jurisdiction.\nA-2.7.1.1.(1)  Good Engineering Practice.Examples of good engineering practice in the design,\nfabrication and installation of non-potable water systems can be found in\n• the ASHRAE Handbooks,\n• the ASPE Handbooks, and\n• CAN/CSA-B128.1, “Design and Installation of Non-Potable Water Systems.”\nA-2.7.2.1.(1)  Aboveground Roof Surfaces.Whileitispossibletoharvestrainwaterfromsurfaces\nother than above-ground roofs, such as patios, lawns, gardens, driveways, roadways, parking garages and\nparking lots, these surfaces are not suitable catchments for rainwater harvesting systems because of water\nquality concerns. Water collected from such surfaces may be contaminated with fertilizer, herbicides, fecal\nmatter, garbage, oil or chemicals.\n2-138  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision BA-2.7.2.4.(1)\nThe outdoor environment in the local area of the building site, including its immediate surroundings, should be\ninvestigated to identify contaminants that could adversely affect the quality of the non-potable water delivered\nby the rainwater harvesting system. Contaminants of concern include industrial and urban traffic emissions,\nand pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. Other factors that can influence the levels of contaminants in\nthe delivered non-potable water include the building'sgeometry, and prevailing winds and seasonal activity in\nthe local area. Design features should be incorporated in the rainwater harvesting system to mitigate the risks\nassociated with any identified contaminants of concern.\nA-2.7.2.2.(1) and 2.7.2.4.(3) and (4)  Treatment for Use.Harvested rainwater used in any\npermitted application must be treated appropriately for its intended end use.\nA-2.7.2.3.(1)  Pedestrian Traffic.The prohibition of pedestrian traffic on roof surfaces stated in\nSentence 2.7.2.3.(1) is not intended to include access to roof surfaces by service personnel, such as window\nwashers or HVAC mechanics.\nA-2.7.2.3.(2)  Roofing and Conveyance Materials.Water is considered to be the “universal solvent.”\nAccordingly, roofing components and conveyance systems that supply rainwater to a rainwater harvesting\nsystem should be constructed of materials that resistdissolution in water. NSF Pro 151-8-1, “Health Effects\nfrom Rainwater Catchment System Components,” although directed at potable water systems, is a useful\nsource of information on roofing materials to consider.\nA-2.7.2.4.(1)  Good Engineering Practice.Examples of good engineering practice in the design,\nfabrication and installation of rainwater harvesting systems can be found in\n• the ASHRAE Handbooks,\n• the ASPE Handbooks,\n• ARCSA/ASPE/ANSI 63, “Rainwater Catchment Systems,” and\n• CSA B805/ICC 805, “Rainwater harvesting systems.”\nNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020Division B  2-139\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\n2-140  Division BNational Plumbing Code of Canada 2020\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision C\nAdministrative Provisions\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\n\nDivision C",

Documentation of Alternative Solutions.Beyond the purposes of demonstrating\ncompliance and acquiring an installation permit, there are other important reasons for requiring that the\nproponent of an alternative solution submit project documentation (i.e. a compliance report) to the authority\nhaving jurisdiction and for the authority having jurisdiction to retain that documentation for a substantial\nperiod following the installation of a plumbing system:\n• Most jurisdictions require that a plumbing system be maintained in compliance with the codes under\nwhich it was installed. Alternative solutions made possible by objective-based codes may have special\nmaintenance requirements, which would be described in the documentation.\n• Documentation helps consultants perform code compliance assessments of existing buildings or facilities\nbefore they are sold and informs current owners or prospective buyers of existing buildings or facilities of\nany limitations pertaining to their future use or development.\n• Documentation provides design professionals with the basic information necessary to design changes to\nan existing plumbing system.\n• An alternative solution could be invalidated by aproposed alteration to a plumbing system. Designers\nand regulators must therefore know the details of the particular alternative solutions that were integral to\nthe original design. Complete documentation should provide insight as to why one alternative solution\nwas chosen over another.\n• Documentation is the “paper trail” of the alternative solution negotiated between the designer and the\nregulator and should demonstrate that a rational process led to the acceptance of the alternative solution\nas an equivalency.\n• It is possible that over time a particular alternative solution may be shown to be inadequate. It would be\nadvantageous for a jurisdiction to know which plumbing systems included that alternative solution as\npart of their design: documentation will facilitate this type of analysis.\n• Project documentation provides important information to a forensic team that is called to investigate an\naccident or why a design failed to provide the level of performance expected.\nThis subject is discussed in further detail in “Recommended Documentation Requirements for Projects Using\nAlternative Solutions in the Context of Objective-Based Codes,” which was prepared for the CCBFC Task\nGroup on Implementation of Objective-Based Codes and is available on the NRC's website.\nThese Notes are included for explanatory purposes only and do not form part of the requirements.
