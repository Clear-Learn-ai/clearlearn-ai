This can be done by referring to one \nof the resources listed below:\n•   Engineering Specifications are available at \nwww.viega.us \n•   Viega guide specifications in Master Spec \nformat are available upon request at  \n1(800) 976-9819.\n•   Contact your local Viega field sales \nrepresentative.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n8\n3 Viega PEX Installation Methods\nThere are three installation methods that Viega \nrecommends to help enhance your water \ndistribution systems performance by reducing \nwater waste and hot water delivery times. These \nmethods consist of the home run, combination and \nbranch and tee systems. The following sections \nprovide information to help select the best system \nbased on the application.\n3.1 Home run systems\nThe Viega ManaBloc manifold system, also known \nas a parallel or home run system, is a unique \nmethod of plumbing that provides homeowners \nwater and energy savings and can reduce water \nwaste by up to 40% compared to traditional \nsystems.\nCombination Installation\nHome Run Installation\nConnectionsLow\nInstallation TimeMedium\nSystem EfficiencyHigh\nFeatures that the Viega ManaBloc system offers its \ncustomers over branch and tee plumbing systems \ninclude:\n•   Faster Hot Water Delivery – properly sized \nlines deliver hot water up to four times faster\n•   Dedicated lines to each fixture use fewer \nfitting connections behind walls\n•   Balanced Water Delivery – multiple fixtures \ncan be used simultaneously without \nnoticeable pressure or temperature changes\n•   Better Control of the Plumbing System – \nindividual ¼-turn shutoff valves provide a \nsimple way of servicing a fixture or adding on \nto the system\n3.2 Combination systems\nA combination system uses multiple manifolds \ncombined with a branch-and-tee supply system. \nThese systems use small manifolds located \nthroughout a structure placed near each main \nfixture group and are supplied by the main hot \nand cold supply lines similar to the branch-and-\ntee system. The manifolds branch multiple lines \nfrom a common location in lieu of multiple tee \nfittings spread throughout. This takes advantage \nof benefits from both types of systems and helps \nkeep hidden fittings to a minimum.\n•   Ideal for areas with multiple fixtures grouped \ntogether\n•   Uses fewer connections behind walls \ncompared to branch and tee\nConnectionsMedium\nInstallation TimeLow\nSystem EfficiencyMedium\n\n9\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n3.3 Branch and tee\nThis method of plumbing is commonly referred to \nas a conventional plumbing system or branch-and-\nmain systems.\nThis system uses a large-diameter “main” supply \nline for both hot and cold water supplies that runs \nthroughout a structure to or near each fixture \ngroup, with smaller “branch” lines teeing off the \nmain to supply each fixture. \n•   Ideal for condensed floor plans\n•   Less installation time\nBranch-and-Tee Installation\nConnectionsHigh\nInstallation TimeLow\nSystem EfficiencyLow\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n10\n4 Viega Manifolds\nViega offers several different manifolds to meet a \nvariety of applications, whether it is a parallel water \ndistribution system or combination installation.\n4.1 Viega manifold markings\nEach Viega manifold is marked where space permits \nwith the following information:\nTo maintain your warranty and be code \ncompliant, use only Viega-approved \nfittings to connect ViegaPEX Ultra \ntubing to the ManaBloc.\nManufacturerVIEGA\nASTM StandardASTM F877 / F1807 / F2159\nTemperature Rating180°F\nCertifications\nUPC\n®\n, cNSF\n®\nus pw-G,\nCSA B137.5,\nICC-ES PMG\n™\n 1038 \nViega polymer manifolds must be \nprotected from UV exposure, which can \ndamage them.

The following design \ncriteria make Viega PEX Press fittings ideal for use \nin potable water applications:\n•   High corrosion resistance\n•   Excellent strength properties \n•   Resistant to stress corrosion\n•   Superior wear properties\n•   Compatible with all materials\nAll Viega PEX tubing, fittings and manifolds are NSF \ncertified for use in potable water systems. \n5.1 Viega PEX Press bronze\nViega PEX Press bronze fittings are manufactured \nfrom a high-quality Zero Lead material specifically \ndesigned for press technology meeting or \nexceeding all manufacturing requirements.\n5.2 Viega PEX Press polymer \nViega PEX Press polymer fittings are \nmanufactured from Radel R\n®\n and incorporate \nthe Viega Smart Connect feature.\n5.2.1 Viega Smart Connect feature\nThe Viega PEX Press \nPolymer fitting system \nincorporates the Viega \nSmart Connect feature, \nwhich is designed to \nidentify unpressed \nconnections by \nintentionally leaking \nunder test pressures of \n0.5 psi to 100 psi. This \ncan be visually identified \nby water leaking from \nthe unpressed fitting \njoint. If testing with \ncompressed air, it is \nnecessary to use an \napproved leak-detect \nsolution (see “Leak \ndetection” on Page \n62), applied to each \nconnection, to identify \na suspected leak. \nPress any connections \nthat may have been \nmissed and/or replace \nconnections found to be \nin question. Repeat the \nsystem pressure test.\n5.3 Viega PEX Press fitting markings\nEach Viega PEX Press fitting is marked where space \npermits with the following information:\nManufacturerVIEGA\nASTM StandardASTM F877\nTemperature\nRating\n180°F (potable)\n200°F (hydronic heating)\nCertifications\ncNSF\n®\nus pw-G, CSA B137.5\nUPC\n®\n or UP Code, cULus\n®\nICC-ES PMG\n™\n 1038 / 1015\nNOTE: All fittings may not be listed with each \norganization shown.\nUse only Viega stainless steel attached \nPEX Press sleeves and press tools with \nViega PEX Press fittings.\nViega PEX Press polymer fittings must \nbe protected from UV exposure, which \ncan damage them.

A ratchet inside the tool prevents the tool \nfrom being opened until the proper force has been \napplied to the press sleeve. A safety release screw \nallows the tool to be opened at any time, but any \nconnection made without full tool compression \nmust be repressed. The tool handles are color \ncoded to match the PEX Press tool locator rings.\nThe reduced grip feature permits one-handed \noperation, making the Viega PEX Press system \nideal for tight spaces and awkward locations. The \ncompression of the tool also allows press connections \nto be made in temperatures as low as -4°F.\n5.4.2 PEX Press power tools \nThe Viega PEX Press connection may also be carried \nout with a Viega power tool. These RIDGID tools are \ndesigned to make the same consistent press as the \nViega PEX Press hand tools. The compression of the \ntool also allows press connections to be made in \ntemperatures as low as 23°F.\nCompact Power Tool\nRP-200-B Kit\n\n13\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n5.5 Making a Viega PEX Press connection with hand tool\n5.5.1 Trimming and inserting the tubing\n5.5.2 Pressing with a hand tool\n5.5.3 Pressing with a power tool\n1. Square off tubing to proper length. Uneven, jagged or irregular cuts will produce unsatisfactory connections.\n2. If using FostaPEX tubing, insert into prep tool, push and turn until no resistance is felt. If using ViegaPEX \nUltra, continue to Step 3.\n3. Insert PEX Press fitting with attached sleeve into tubing and engage fully. \n4. Ensure full tubing insertion at view holes in attached press sleeve. Full insertion means tubing must be \ncompletely visible in at least two view holes and partially visible in the third.\n5. Position press tool perpendicular over press sleeve, resting it against the tool locator ring.\n \nNote: The tool locator ring must be in the factory-installed position while making a press to provide a  \nconsistent leakproof PEX press connection. It may be necessary to rotate the tool locator ring to avoid \ninterference between the ring and tool.\n6.  Close handles, using trigger to reduce grip span if desired.\n7.  Extend handle and continue ratcheting until automatic tool release occurs at proper compression force.\n8.  Warning: The PEX press connection is not leakproof when the tool has been opened by emergency release. \n     The tool locator ring must be present to ensure a proper PEX Press connection.\n5.  Insert the appropriate Viega PEX Press jaw into the press tool and push in the holding pin until it locks.\n6. Open jaw and position perpendicular over press sleeve, resting it against the tool locator ring.  \nNote: The tool locator ring must be in the factory-installed position while making a press to provide a \nconsistent leakproof PEX press connection. It may be necessary to rotate the tool locator ring to avoid \ninterference between the ring and tool.\n7.  Start pressing process; hold the trigger until the jaw has automatically released.\n8.  When press connection is complete, open and remove jaw. \n9.

This tubing can be easily \nbent by hand like the ViegaPEX Ultra tubing but holds \nits shape after bending (combining the benefits of both \nrigid and flexible tubing). The result is fewer fittings \nand bend supports and less labor. A unique feature of \nFostaPEX is that the inner layer is fully dimensioned \nBlack ViegaPEX Ultra tubing. The aluminum and \nouter PE layers surround the inner PEX tubing. This \nconstruction allows the inner layer alone to meet all \ntemperature and pressure requirements of the system. \nUsing the prep tool to remove the outer layers allows \nthe use of the standard Viega PEX Press bronze and \npolymer fitting systems, which reduces tooling costs for \nthe contractor and simplifies connections.\n8.1 FostaPEX properties and performance\nLinear Expansion Coefficient: \n•    0.16 inch per 100 feet per 10°F\nTemperature and Pressure Ratings: \n•    200°F at 80 psi *\n•    180°F at 100 psi\n•    73.4°F at 160 psi\n*For non-potable hydronic heating systems only\nUV Resistance:\n•    Maximum exposure 12 months.

See Table 9.1.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n20\n10.1 ManaBloc\nThe general sizing information shown may be \nappropriate for many ManaBloc installations. These \nrecommendations are based on flow rates of typical \nfixtures that require 8 psi residual pressure. \nThe length of distribution tubing run between the Viega \nManaBloc and each fixture shall be 60 feet or less \nto maximize optimal performance of the ManaBloc \nsystem. Exceeding this recommended distance affects \nthe system’s ability to efficiently deliver hot water, \nlengthening the time it takes for hot water to reach the \nfixture as well as increasing water waste.\n10.1.1 Supply and distribution line sizing \nThe best water and energy savings of a ManaBloc \nsystem are realized when distribution lines are sized \naccording to the fixture demand and the length of \nthe individual line. Viega recommends the following \ntube sizing:\nTypical supply line size:\n• ¾\" up to 2½ baths\n• 1\" up to 4½ baths\nTypical distribution line size:\n• ⅜\" up to 2½ GPM fixture flow requirement \n(lavs, toilets, bidets, bar sinks, kitchen sinks, \ndishwashers) \n• ½\" up to 4 GPM fixture flow requirement (hose \n   bibbs, tubs, showers, washing machines, whirlpool \nbaths, soaking tubs, etc.)\nConsult the fixture manufacturer’s literature to \ndetermine the actual fill rate and residual pressure \nrequirements for distribution line size. In addition, \nconfirm with local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) \nfor acceptable PEX tubing size.\nHose Bibb Note: If a hose bibb is primarily for \nirrigation purposes, it should be supplied from the \nmain service line prior to the ManaBloc. \nA Viega PEX Press and PEX Crimp ManaBloc come \nwith ½\" ports that are designed to fit both ⅜\" and ½\" \nPEX port adapters.\nDesign factors for installing a home run system\nWater heater placement\nThe Viega ManaBloc should be as close as possible \nto the water heater to minimize extra water from being \nstored in the larger hot water supply lines between the \nManaBloc and water heater. \nThe longer the hot water supply line is, the greater \nthe volume of water needed to purge through that \nline and faucet before hot water is available. This \ncreates water waste and longer hot water delivery \ntimes. \n10 Viega PEX System Design and Sizing\n10.1.2 Plumbing code compliance                \n(home run / parallel systems)\nThe Viega ManaBloc system is listed to ASTM F876/\nF877 standards for cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) \ndistribution systems. The below model plumbing \ncodes recognize and allow the use of PEX distribution \nsystems:\n•   International Plumbing Code (IPC)\n•   Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC)\n•   National Plumbing Code (NPC)\nSizing of Parallel Water Distribution Systems \n(ManaBloc) is addressed in these model plumbing \ncodes under their respective water supply and \ndistribution sections. The Viega ManaBloc is also \nIAPMO (UPC) and ICC-ES PMG listed for use with ⅜\" \nand ½\" PEX tubing sizes for water distribution.\nProper water distribution line sizing to each fixture\nThis is crucial for overall system performance. If you \noversize a distribution line to a fixture (½\" PEX line \nsupplying a sink instead of a ⅜\" PEX line) you are \nessentially doubling the volume of water being stored \nin that line. It can take roughly twice as long to purge \nan oversized line compared to a properly sized line. \nThe fixture is what dictates water flow (federally \nmandated, governed by code). The tubing applies a \nfriction loss dictated by its size and length. Therefore, \nas long as you do not undersize a distribution line \nor run it excessive distances (60 feet or greater), the \nsystem will perform properly, maintaining sufficient \npressure and flow. \nThe length of a distribution line run to \neach fixture \nThis is just as important as properly sizing each \ndistribution line. Length of a distribution line run can \ndrastically affect the performance of a Viega ManaBloc \nsystem. The longer the line is, the more water being \nstored within it. Therefore, it will take longer to purge \nit out before hot water can reach the fixture. The \nManaBloc should be located somewhat central to your \nfixture groups, keeping within 60 feet or less of each \nfixture for maximum performance. \nIf this cannot be accomplished with one ManaBloc, \nmultiple ManaBlocs may be required. Place one at \neach end of the home to split the distribution line \ndistance between them. (See “13.5 Multiple ManaBloc \ninstallations” on Page 31.)\n\n21\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n10.2 Combination systems\nPEX combination systems can be sized in a similar \nmanner as a typical branch-and-tee system. \nRefer to your local or model plumbing code for \nthe required tube and manifold sizing based on \nthe system demand (Water Service Fixture Units, \nWSFU). If low service pressure is present, Viega \nprovides the equivalent feet of PEX tubing factors \nfor PEX fittings to ensure any additional pressure \ndrop is accounted for in your design.\n10.3 Branch-and-tee systems\nThe same general sizing practices can be applied \nto a PEX branch-and-tee system as with any code-\napproved piping material. Refer to your local or \nmodel plumbing code for proper tube sizing.\nDesign factors for installing combination systems\nDesign the layout as condensed as possible\nKeep the main hot supply line close to the fixture \ngroups with the branch lines shorter than six feet. \nThis will help provide hot water in a reasonable \namount of time with less wasted water.\n \nThe limiting factor for installers to accomplish an \noptimal design is how spread out the fixture groups \nare within the structure. \nIf there is a floor plan that incorporates stacked or \nback-to-back fixture groups, a combination system \ncan be an effective alternative to a parallel system.\n \nDesign factors for installing branch-and-main \n systems \nJust like the combination system, condensed floor \nplan layouts are preferable to minimize the length and \nthe amount of water stored in the main supply line, \nminimizing the amount of water purged before hot \nwater reaches the fixtures. These systems can also \nsuffer from fluctuating pressure during multiple fixture \nuse.\nIf the fixture groups are not condensed, a branch-and-\nmain system will have slow hot water delivery times \nand substantial water waste. \n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n22\n11.1 General\nViega PEX systems should be designed following standard plumbing engineering practice. Follow local codes to \ndetermine minimum tubing size and required fixture pressures. \nPressure drop through fittings can be estimated from the charts below. Values are expressed in equivalent length \nof PEX, so add the values for the relevant fittings to the length of tubing in the run, and then determine the total \npressure drop from the charts on the following page.\nTo determine the pressure drop through runs of ViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX tubing, refer to the pressure drop \nchart on the following page. For a known flow rate, tubing size and tubing length, the pressure drop through the \nrun can be easily determined.\nPEX Crimp Eco Brass Fittings\nSizeCouplingElbowTee RunTee Branch\n⅜\"2.99.22.99.4\n½\"2.09.42.210.4\n¾\"0.69.41.98.9\n1\"1.310.02.311.0\nPEX Crimp PolyAlloy Fittings\nSizeCoupling\nElbowTee RunTee Branch\n⅜\"10.9\n22.3N/AN/A\n½\"7.1\n16.57.217.9\n¾\"4.8\n17.46.617.7\n1\"4.5\n18.06.017.0\nPEX Press Bronze Fittings\nSizeCouplingElbowTee RunTee Branch\n⅜\"2.99.22.99.4\n½\"2.09.42.210.4\n¾\"1.08.01.09.0\n1\"1.010.02.010.0\n1¼\"2.011.02.011.0\n1½\"2.013.02.012.0\n2\"1.019.02.018.0\n11 System Sizing and Calculations \nPEX Press Polymer Fittings\nSizeCouplingElbowTee RunTee Branch\n⅜\"4.514.36.514.7\n½\"2.612.63.914.0\n¾\"2.518.93.619.1\n1\"3.117.73.818.4\n1¼\"4.018.66.418.7\n1½\"5.229.47.928.3\n2\"8.936.410.237.5\n11.2.1 Viega PEX Press friction loss — equivalent feet of SDR9 PEX tubing\n11.2.2 Viega PEX Crimp friction loss — equivalent feet of SDR9 PEX tubing\n11.2 Viega PEX fittings\n\n23\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n11.3 ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\n11.3.1 Flow Velocity Table\nFlow Velocity  ft/sec\nFlow Rate\nGPM\n⅜½ ¾1    1¼1½2    \n0.51.70.9\nVelocity < 0.5 ft/sec0.752.51.40.7\n1.03.31.80.90.5\n1.55.02.71.40.80.6\n2.06.73.61.81.10.70.5\n2.58.34.52.31.40.90.7\n3.010.05.42.71.61.10.8\n3.56.33.21.91.30.90.5\n4.07.23.62.21.51.10.6\n4.58.14.12.51.71.20.7\n5.09.14.52.71.81.30.8\n6.010.95.43.32.21.60.9\n7.06.43.82.61.81.1\n8.0 7.34.42.92.11.2\n9.08.24.93.32.41.4\n10.09.15.53.72.61.5\n11.010.06.04.02.91.7\n12.010.96.64.43.21.8\n13.011.87.14.83.42.0\n14.07.75.13.72.2\n15.08.25.54.02.3\n16.08.85.94.22.5\n17.09.36.34.52.6\n18.09.96.64.82.8\n19.010.47.05.02.9\n20.011.07.45.33.1\n25.09.26.63.8\n30.0\nVelocity > 12 ft/sec\n11.07.94.6\n35.09.25.4\n40.010.66.2\n45.011.96.9\n50.07.7\n55.08.5\n60.09.2\n65.010.0\n70.010.8\n75.011.5\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n24\n11.3.2 Pressure Loss Table\nFlow Rate\nGPM\n60°F (16°C) Water\nPressure Loss PSI/ 100 ft of Pipe\n⅜½ ¾1    1¼1½2    \n0.52.0\n0.754.1\n1.07.01.6\nPressure Loss  <1 \nPSI\n1.514.93.4\n2.025.45.81.1\n2.538.58.71.6\n3.053.912.22.3\n3.516.23.0\n4.020.83.91.1\n4.525.84.81.4\n5.031.45.91.7\n6.044.08.22.4\n7.010.93.21.2\n8.014.04.11.6\n9.017.45.11.9\n10.021.16.22.31.0\n11.025.27.42.81.2\n12.029.68.83.31.5\n13.034.310.13.81.7\n14.011.64.42.0\n15.013.25.02.2\n16.014.95.62.5\n17.016.76.32.8\n18.018.57.03.1\n19.020.57.73.4\n20.022.58.53.81.0\n25.012.85.71.5\n30.0\nPressure Loss \nExcessive as \nFlow velocity \nis > 12 ft/sec\n18.08.02.2\n35.010.72.9\n40.013.73.7\n45.017.04.6\n50.05.6\n55.06.6\n60.07.8\n65.09.0\n70.010.4\n75.011.8\nNOTE: Pressure Loss based on Hazen-Williams Formula (C = 150)\nPressure Loss for Actual Length can be calculated by following formula:               \nActual Length / 100 ft  X Value from chart above\n11.3.3 Velocity limits\nViega recommends the following design \nvelocities for hot and cold PEX water \ndistribution systems:\n•   Domestic cold water — 10 fps\n•   Domestic hot water — 8 fps\nThe flow velocity through Viega’s \nPEX fittings does not fall under these \nlimitations.

(Refer to Section “11.2 \nViega PEX fittings” on Page 22.)\n\n25\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n12.1 Below grade and service line\nViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX tubing may both be \nused underground and for water service piping. When \nrunning lines underground, it is important to provide a \nstable, continuous trench base to support the tubing. \nAlways allow sufficient slack when tubing is laid in \ntrenches. Snake the tubing slightly side-to-side to \nprovide for contraction due to temperature change. \nDo not use blocking to support tubing. PEX tubing \ncan be damaged by contact with sharp objects. \nEnsure that trench bottom and fill do not contain sharp \nrocks or other items. In good soil conditions tubing \nmay be placed directly on trench bottom. In poor soil \nconditions (rocky, loose, etc.) the trench should be \nexcavated at least six inches below the tubing level and \nbackfilled with appropriate material to provide a stable \nbase (coarse sand, pea gravel or similar). \nBackfill material must be free of large rocks, glass or \nother sharp objects. Provide sufficient coverage over \ntubing so that expected traffic loads will not deform \ntubing (consult local codes). Compact this material to at \nleast 6\" above the tube.\nTrench in poor soil\nTrench in good soil\nDo not install ViegaPEX Ultra tubing where soil is or \nmay become contaminated with solvents, fuels or \nsimilar chemicals. Do not install tubing above or below \nseptic tanks, leach fields, pits or cesspools.\nAlways follow local codes when installing ViegaPEX \nUltra tubing.

The foundation end of the rigid pipe must also be \nsupported by the foundation wall. \nSlight over-excavations (12\" or less) do not require \nrigid sleeving when the area below the tubing is back-\nfilled and well compacted to the level of penetration. \nAlways sleeve plastic tubing where it passes through \nconcrete. Do not use oil-based caulks or sealants in \ncontact with tubing.\n12.3 Direct burial of Viega PEX fittings\nInstalling PEX fittings in direct contact with ground \nsoil (direct burial) may require protective measures. \nRefer to the below direct burial requirements for \neach fitting type.\nViega PEX Press fittings (Zero Lead bronze and \npolymer) do not require any protective wrap for \ndirect burial installations.\nViega PEX Crimp fittings (Eco Brass and Polymer) \nand their crimp rings shall be securely wrapped \nwith tape meeting the following criteria for direct \nburial installations.\n•   Self-fusing\n•   Formaldehyde-free\n•   Fully cured silicone tape\n•   Minimum of 0.020\" thickness\nThe wrap is available from Viega (part number \n15320).\n12.4 Concrete\nViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX tubing may be run within \nconcrete slabs. All penetration points must be sleeved \nto prevent tubing damage (entry/exit points, expansion \njoints, etc.). Penetrations in walls, etc., may be sealed \nwith silicone caulk. Do not use oil-based caulk. Every \neffort should be made to use only continuous lengths \nof tubing within a slab. If the use of fittings buried in \nconcrete is necessary for repairs, all such fittings must \nbe wrapped with insulation, noncorrosive tape (no \nadhesives) or sleeved to prevent corrosion. The wrap \nshall be a self-fusing, formaldehyde-free, fully cured \nsilicone tape with a minimum of 0.020\" thickness. \nThe wrap is available from Viega (part number \n15320). Contact a Viega representative for additional \ninformation on approved wrapping materials. \nWhen running tubing within a concrete slab, the tubing \nmust be fastened to the reinforcing mesh or rebar \nevery two to three feet to prevent it from floating up \nwhile concrete is curing.\n12.5 Installing under the slab\nWhen installing ViegaPEX Ultra or FostaPEX   tubing \nin the ground under the slab, the tubing should be \nsnaked from side to side in the prepared trench. The \ntrench bottom should be smooth and free of rocks and \ndebris. Lay the tubing directly on the trench bottom. \nTubing must be continuously supported by the trench \nbottom. Use only continuous lengths of tubing in or \nunder slab. Any connections shall be outside the slab \nor in an access box.\nPEX tubing must \nbe sleeved at \nall expansion \njoints and every \npoint where it \nenters, exits \nor penetrates \nthe slab. For \nexpansion joints \nthat are to be \ncut, the tubing \nmust be dipped \nbelow the slab to \nprevent damage.\nElbow sleeves \nprotect tubing at concrete \nslab penetrations\nTubing must be fastened \nto the reinforcing mesh \non rebar\n\n27\nIM-PF 724596 0417\nPEX tubing should always be shielded \nfrom direct and indirect sunlight\nProtect all exposed tubing with an opaque covering\n12.6 Protecting ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\nProtect tubing and fittings from UV \nexposure. \nDue to the nature of slab-on-grade installation, tubing \nand fittings may be exposed to UV light for unspecified \nperiods of time. \nTo prevent damage from UV exposure, all ViegaPEX \nUltra tubing and polymer fittings shall be protected \nwith an opaque covering (black plastic polyethylene \nbag or sheeting) immediately after they have been \ninstalled. \nPEX tubing shall be stored under cover, shielded \nfrom direct and indirect sunlight when the material is \nstored for any length of time. Short exposure times \nof ViegaPEX Ultra, FostaPEX and polymer fittings \nnot exceeding the total accumulated recommended \nexposure time are permissible.\nInforming the other trades of the presence of the lines \nmay help prevent damage.\nWhen the tubing penetrates at an angle in relation \nto the hole, it may be subject to a sharp edge that \ncan damage the pipe. Acceptable sleeving materials \ninclude flexible plastic tubing, foam pipe insulation or \nan approved plastic insulator. \nIt is not necessary to sleeve PEX when penetrating \nwooden framing members or non-metallic finished or \nunfinished walls. However, if there is a doubt, sleeve \nthe pipe or install an insulator.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n28\n13 Installing the ManaBloc\nCold Water \nSupply  \nInlet or Outlet\nCold Port(s)\nHot Port(s)\nValve Key\nHot Water \nSupply Inlet\nPort Valve\nCold Port(s)\nPlastic Mounting\nBracket\nCold Water \nSupply Inlet\nor Outlet\n13.1   Overview and carton contents\nAdditional package contents include:\n• Valve T-Handle\n• Instruction Sheet/Drill Guide\n• Port Labels\n13.2 Location\nBefore installing the ManaBloc, review the following \ninstructions.\nNOTE: The ManaBloc is much like an electrical \nbreaker box. When a fixture needs repair, the line \nto that fixture may be shut off at the ManaBloc, \neliminating the need to shut down the water supply \nfor the entire house. This feature requires that the \nManaBloc be accessible after installation.\nCOLD WEATHER CAUTION! The thermoplastic \ncomponents of the ManaBloc, like all \nthermoplastics, have decreased resistance to impact \nunder freezing conditions and can be damaged. \nCare must be exercised when installation occurs in \nfreezing conditions.\nBEFORE INSTALLING THE MANABLOC, MAKE SURE \nTHE LOCATION REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET.\nTake extra caution when handling the ManaBloc \nin temperatures that are below freezing. Tubing \npenetrations may require sleeving or the installation \n \nof an insulator.\n1. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES shall the ManaBloc \nbe located in a permanently covered area (behind \nsheetrock, plywood, paneling) or where freezing \ntemperatures may occur. Do not install in direct \nsunlight. THE MANABLOC MUST BE ACCESSIBLE \nand there shall be sufficient clear area in front of the \nManaBloc to provide access.\n2. When local code allows, mount the ManaBloc \nunit in a fire-rated wall, provided an access door \nmeeting the same rating requirements as the wall is \ninstalled over the access opening.\n3. \nWhen installing the ManaBloc in a location \nother than between studs, provisions must be \nmade to support the tubing runs as they exit the \nManaBloc. (See “16.3 Bending ViegaPEX Ultra \ntubing” on Page 44.)\n4. Any installed cover panel shall allow access to  \nthe ManaBloc and its mounting screws, the port \nvalves, distribution line connections and supply  \nline connections.\n5. To maximize potential water and energy savings, \nthe ManaBloc should be mounted as close as \nis practical to the hot water source, taking the \nfollowing into consideration:\na. When the ManaBloc is mounted above the  \nwater heater, there shall be a minimum of 36\" \n    of connecting tubing between the water heater \nand the ManaBloc to reduce the chance of \n    heat stacking.\nInternal Divider Plate\nTypical 24-Port ManaBloc\n\n29\nIM-PF 724596 0417\nb. When the ManaBloc is mounted beside the \nwater heater and is connected with tubing \nincorporating a horizontal flow, there shall be at \nleast 18\" of developed tube length. Mounting \nthe ManaBloc within eight feet of developed \ntube length of the water heater will minimize \ndelivery time of hot water to individual fixtures. \nThe ManaBloc may be mounted closer than \n12\" to the hot water source (tank) if it does not \nexceed the minimum allowable vertical and \nhorizontal spacing outlined in this section.\nc. Install the unit in an area that is centrally located \nto the most dense concentration of served \nfixtures. Some applications will require that the \nManaBloc be mounted farther than eight feet \nfrom the hot water source. See design factors \nfor installing a parallel system, “3.1 Home \nrun systems” on Page 8, for suggestions \non reducing hot water delivery times in these \ninstances.\n6. DO NOT install the ManaBloc within a continuously \nrecirculating hot water plumbing loop. The \nManaBloc, however, may be supplied from a  \nrecirculating hot water loop. Refer to “Section 17.10 \nDomestic hot water circulating systems” on Page \n55 for recommended piping options.\nManaBloc Locations\n18” TO 8’ TOTAL\nDEVELOPED TUBE LENGTH\n36” MIN\nManaBloc Supply Piping Options\n7.    Position the ManaBloc so that it can be securely \nfastened through the holes provided in the mounting \nbrackets. The mounting surface should be as flat as \npossible so as not to induce any twisting or bending \nforces on the unit. The mounting straps (part \nnumber 45716) simplify mounting between studs on \n16\" centers.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n30\nThe main service line to the ManaBloc may include \na main shutoff valve, as required by local code. \nAlthough a shutoff valve for the main service line at the \nManaBloc itself is not required, it can be a beneficial \noption for a homeowner and is recommended. \nLocal code may also require the installation of a check \nvalve, Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV), back flow \npreventer, etc. To prevent debris and other particles \nfrom entering the system, a strainer may be installed \nin the service line.\nOptional\nManaBloc\nshutoff\nIf a main inlet/outlet will not be used, it must be \ncapped. (Use part number 53601.) \n13.3 Draining the ManaBloc unit\nIf the ManaBloc system has been filled with water and \nthere exists the possibility that the ambient temperature \nwill drop close to or below 32°F (0°C), the ManaBloc \nunit MUST be drained to prevent irreparable damage. \nThe process of draining involves loosening and removal \nof one or more supply line connections and two \ndistribution lines from the ManaBloc. \nNOTE: Depending on the installation, some supply \nconnections may be capped. If that is the case, remove \nthe cap(s) as instructed below.\n1. Turn off all water supply(s) feeding the \nManaBloc. Open both sides of all fixtures \nserved by the manifold and leave the fixtures \nopen during draining. For each port of the \nManaBloc where there is a distribution line \nconnected, make sure the port valve is in the \nopen position.\n2. Loosen and remove the bottom supply \nconnection(s) (or cap(s)) and the lowest pair of hot \nand cold distribution lines. \n3. As the connections are removed, most of the \nwater contained in the ManaBloc main bores and \nsome of the water in the distribution lines should \npurge from the system. \n4. Allow to drain until no water purges.\n5. Reattach the supply line(s) or cap(s) and the \ndistribution lines. Tighten the supply connections \naccording to the instructions in Section 14.5. \nWhen reconnecting the distribution lines, DO \nNOT overtighten the connections. These only \nneed to be hand-tight.\nNOTE: The procedure described above will leave \na small amount of water in the ManaBloc unit and, \ndepending on the installation, may leave some or most \nof the water in the distribution lines. This remaining \nwater should not cause damage to the manifold unit \nor to the PEX distribution lines in the event of a freeze. \nHowever, for complete assurance that freeze damage \nwill not occur, perform the following additional steps.\n\n31\nIM-PF 724596 0417\nDomestic Hot Water Circulating Loop Supplying Two ManaBlocs\nHot\nCold\nCold Supply\nHot W\nater Supply\nWater Heater\nCheck Valves\nHot Return\nHot Return\nEnd Cap\nHot Water Supply\nCold Water Supply\nCirc\nPump\n13.4 Draining the ManaBloc system\n1. Loosen and remove all of the supply line \nconnections (or caps) and all of the distribution \nlines from the ManaBloc.\n2. Remove the four attachment screws and \nwithdraw the ManaBloc unit from its mounting. \nNote: Grasp the unit firmly before removing the \nlast attachment screw to prevent the unit from \nfalling and being damaged.\n3. Completely drain the ManaBloc unit by \ninverting the unit several times until there \nis no water coming from any of the supply \nconnections or ports.\n4. To purge the PEX distribution lines, first make \nsure that both sides of all of the fixtures are in \nthe open position. Using low-pressure air from \na tank or compressor, force the water from the \nlines by connecting the air pressure source to \neach line one at a time and blow air through the \nlines until no water flows from the fixtures.\n5. Reattach the ManaBloc and reconnect the \nsupply and distribution line connections.\nNOTE: When reconnecting the distribution lines, \nDO NOT overtighten the connections. Compression \nconnections should require only about ⅛ turn past \nhand-tight when reinstalling connections that were \npreviously tightened to the specifications outlined \nin this installation guide. PEX Press and PEX Crimp \nconnections must be only hand-tightened.\n13.5 Multiple ManaBloc installations\nIf a home requires multiple ManaBlocs to service \nthe number of fixtures in the home, these guidelines \nshould be followed if the ManaBlocs are closely \nlocated to each other.\n• Consider dividing high-demand fixtures between \n   the units\n• Consider a reasonable division, i.e. upstairs/\ndownstairs, east/west or front/back\nLocating a remote ManaBloc\nA remote ManaBloc is sometimes recommended \nto achieve maximum efficiency from your \nManaBloc system. It is advantageous when the \nline lengths are excessive from one centralized \nManaBloc unit. When the home requires more than \none unit due to the number of fixtures or size of \nthe home, consider locating a remote unit near an \noutlying group of fixtures.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n32\n14.1 Mounting the ManaBloc between studs\nDimensions in these instructions are for 16\" stud \ncenters and must be adjusted for other stud spacing. \nOnce the general location of the ManaBloc has been \ndetermined (see “13.2 Location” on Page 28), the \nManaBloc may be mounted to a suitable surface \nbetween a pair of adjacent studs. For 16\" stud \nspacing, the mounting straps (part number 45716) can \nsimplify installation.\n1. Lay the ManaBloc, plastic brackets down, on \na suitable flat surface that is large enough to \naccommodate the full length of the ManaBloc. \nPlace a mounting strap under each plastic mounting \nbracket (located at the top and bottom ends of the \nManaBloc). Attach the plastic mounting bracket at \none end of the ManaBloc to the two outer center \nholes of a mounting strap using the provided self-\ntapping pan-head screws. The screw heads must \nbe on the accessible side of the mounting strap. \nRepeat at the other end of the ManaBloc. Tighten \nscrews securely.\n2. Standing behind the stud wall, measure up from \nthe floor and make a mark on the back of one of the \nstuds to represent the top of the ManaBloc. (See \nillustration.) \nThis mark should be between four feet and six \nfeet from the floor but may be at any height, \nprovided the height will allow all valves on the \nManaBloc to be accessible. With a framing square \nor level, transfer and mark the noted height on \n \nthe other stud.\nNOTE: A residence intended for disabled persons may \nrequire that the ManaBloc be mounted lower in the \nwall to provide access.\n3.   Standing behind the stud wall, hold the ManaBloc \nfacing away from you and align the top of the \nUPPER mounting strap to the line on the stud that \nyou made in Step 2. Loosely attach this mounting \nstrap flush to the back outer edge of one stud using \na ¾\" or longer drywall or other suitable wood screw \n(A).

Mark a location for the \ntop of the ManaBloc.\n4. Line up the LOWER mounting strap with the back \nouter edge of the stud and attach it in the same \nmanner (B). Attach the remaining strap ends (C and \nD) to the other stud, and tighten all screws.\n*Optional\n\n33\nIM-PF 724596 0417\nMark the centers of the top and bottom \nManaBloc ports (A, B)\n5. Standing in front of the wall, using a framing square \nor straight edge, mark the center line position of \nthe top and bottom ports onto both studs. (See \nillustration.) \n6. Detach the ManaBloc from its mounting straps (or \n1x4s) and remove it from the installation area to \nprevent wood chips or other debris from falling into \nthe unit.\n7. Transfer the port location marks made in Step 5 \n to the insides of the stud cavity using a square \n and pencil.\n8. Measure 1⅝\" from the mounting surface. Draw a \nvertical line on the studs that passes through each \nof the horizontal port center lines marked in Step 7. \n(See illustration below.) Be sure to mark the inside \nof both studs. \n9. Push a small nail through the printed center line at \n one end of the Drill Guide (A). Push the nail into the\n cross formed where the top port mark intersects\n with the 1⅝\" mark. Tap the nail into the stud to \n hold the Drill Guide in place.\n10. Push a small nail through the printed center line on \nthe lower end of the Drill Guide with the center line \nof the port (B). Tap the nail into the stud to hold \nthe Drill Guide in place.\n1⅝\"\n11. Using an awl, nail or other pointed tool (C), mark \nthe stud by tapping through the Drill Guide at each \nprinted center line between the two nails. \n12. Carefully remove the Drill Guide and repeat the \nmarking procedure on the adjacent stud.\n13. Drill ¾\" holes through both studs at each \nmarked location. Be sure to hold the drill level \nperpendicular to the stud to prevent drilling holes \nat an angle. Remove any splinters or burrs made \nduring drilling.\n14. Mark and drill any holes for main water supply \n and hot water supply/return lines at this time. A \n1¼\" bit will provide adequate clearance for ¾\" or \n1\" tubing. The tubing shall enter and/or exit the \nManaBloc in a straight line so as not to induce \nbending stress on the ManaBloc. Necessary \nelbows, couplings and tees are allowed in the main \nwater supply lines.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n34\n15. Reattach the ManaBloc to the mounting straps.\nWhen the ManaBloc is installed prior to \nwall finishing operations, the unit MUST be \nprotected from paint, texture compounds \nand drywall dust.\nNOTE: The wall in which the ManaBloc is mounted \nmust be accessible from both sides during installation \nto use the mounting straps.\n14.2 Mounting the ManaBloc between studs \nwithout use of mounting straps\nIf not using the mounting straps, this procedure applies:\n1.    Cut two pieces of lumber (1x4 — or ¾\" plywood — \napproximately 3½\" wide) to a length that provides a \nsnug fit BETWEEN two studs.\nDrill ¾\" holes for \ndistribution lines, 1¼\" \nholes for supply lines.\n1x4s attach at the back, inside the studs, \nand the ManaBloc is centered between \nthe studs.\n2.   The top of the ManaBloc should be between four \nfeet and six feet from the floor (but may be at any \nheight provided that it maintains accessibility to \nall of the ports on the ManaBloc). Make a mark \nnear the back of the inside of one stud that would \nrepresent the top of the ManaBloc. With a framing \nsquare or level, mirror the mark on the inside back \nof the other stud. \n3.    Attaching the ManaBloc between the studs:\n    a. Measure the total length of the ManaBloc.  \n    b. Attach the first (UPPER) 1x4 inside and flush to \n     the back of the studs (see TOP VIEW, below left)  \n at a height where the center of its width is      \n centered on the marks from Step 2.\n    c. Attach the remaining (LOWER) 1x4 inside and \n     flush to the back of the studs at a distance below \n     the upper 1x4 that is equal to the length of the \n     ManaBloc (Step 3a) when measured from the \n     top of the upper 1x4 to the bottom of the lower\n     1x4. (See FRONT VIEW illustration.)\n4.    CENTER THE MANABLOC IN THE STUD CAVITY: \nAttach the ManaBloc to the 1x4s with four ½\" - ¾\" \ndrywall screws. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN.\n5.

A suitable base for the ManaBloc can be \nconstructed from a section of ½\" or thicker \nplywood that is a minimum 22½\" wide and slightly \nlonger than the overall length of the ManaBloc.\n2. Securely attach a length of 2x4, or other suitable \nframing material with a thickness of 1½\" and about \n3½\" wide on the left and right sides of the mounting \nbase running the full length of the ManaBloc. (See \nillustration below.) The 2x4s will be used to secure the \ndistribution lines at the correct height as they exit the \nManaBloc. (Support clamps not to exceed 6\" spacing \nfrom end of ports.)\n4\"- 6\"\n90°\n3. Attach the mounting base to the structure in a \nsuitable location. (See “13.2 Location” on Page \n28.) The base should be mounted so the top of \nthe ManaBloc is between four feet and six feet from \nthe floor but may be at any height provided that the \nheight maintains accessibility to all the ports on the \nManaBloc.\n4. The mounting base must be firmly attached to a \nstructure solid enough to support, at a minimum, \nthe weight of the ManaBloc filled with water. The \nbase should be square and level.\n22½\"\nLonger \nthan\nManaBloc\n2x42x4\n22½\"\nLonger \nthan\nManaBloc\n2x42x4\nMANABLOC\n®\n5. Center the ManaBloc on the base both vertically and \nhorizontally, as shown here. Attach the ManaBloc to \nthe mounting base with four ½\" or longer drywall or \nwood screws through the holes in the plastic brackets \non the ManaBloc. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN.\n6. As the distribution lines are connected to the \nManaBloc (see “15.3 Connecting distribution lines \nto the ManaBloc” on Page 39), ensure that the \ntubing exits the unit at a 90° angle to the center \nline of the ManaBloc so as not to induce bending \nstress on the ManaBloc.\n7. When attaching the distribution line tubing to the \n    2x4 supports, be sure to use appropriately sized \nViega tubing clamps. (For example, use part \nnumber 52000 for ⅜\" tubing and part number \n52020 for ½\" tubing.) \nUse one clamp per tube to ensure that the tubing \nis held securely. Position clamps NO FARTHER \nthan 6\" from the end of the port. DO NOT pull \ntubing tight. \n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n36\n14.4 Mounting the MiniBloc\n1. For proper bracket spacing, measure distance \n    between the center ribs of the first and last \n    MiniBloc modules. Mark this distance on the\n    selected mounted surface.\n2.    Align the outside edge of each bracket within \n    each end mark. Mounting brackets shall be \n    mounted level and parallel to each other before \n    affixing the MiniBloc manifold. NOTE: Use both \n    mounting brackets provided with each MiniBloc \n    manifold. Ensure the mounting surface is suitable \n    to support the weight of the manifold and \n    attached tubing when filled with water.\n3.    Use two wood screws per bracket, 1\" or longer, \n    to prevent misalignment.\n4.    Position bottom metal tie-rod into the bottom clip \n    of the mounting brackets then roll manifold \n    toward top clip. The MiniBloc may be mounted \n    either vertically or horizontally.\n5.    Complete mounting by firmly pushing the \nMiniBloc toward the top clip of the mounting \nbrackets, which should spread and snap over \ntop metal tie-rod. \nHorizontal \nMount\nVertical\nMount\n4\n3\n1\n2\nHorizontal \nMount\nVertical\nMount\n5\n\n37\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n14.5 Mounting Viega PEX Press and PEX Crimp Polymer manifolds\n4\n1\n1\n2   3\n4\n5\n6\nA\nA\n2\n3\nViega recommends using a minimum of two mounting brackets on manifolds with three ports and larger.\n1. Measure the distance (A) between the first and last set of manifold ports (as shown). Using a straight \n edge, mark dimension (A) on mounting surface. Ensure the mounting surface is level and suitable to \n support the weight of the manifold filled with water.\n2. Align the 1¼\" lock clips* (B) with the marks transferred on the mounting surface from Step 1 and \n attach them using a 1\" or longer screw appropriate for the mounting surface. \n3. With the lock clips in the open position, insert the manifold body into the clips, centering them between \n the end ports. \n4. Push evenly on both ends of the manifold until lock clips snap manifold body firmly into place. \n NOTE: Lock the clips into their second locking position to adequately secure the manifold.\n* Lock clips sold separately (part number 58075).\nB\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n38\n15 Installing Manifold Distribution Lines\nSelf-adhesive labels are supplied with the ManaBloc. \nMark tubes pulled as a bundle or those not connected \nimmediately at both ends with a permanent marker to \ndesignate the fixture supplied.\n15.1 Installing manifold distribution lines\nRun distribution lines continuously in the most direct \nroute from the ManaBloc to the fixtures. \nA distribution line may contain a coupling or other \nfitting for purposes such as repairing a damaged section \nof tubing, handling a change of direction that cannot \nbe made within the minimum bend radius guidelines, \naccommodating a fixture location change that requires a \nlonger line or supplying a low-demand accessory (i.e., ice \nmaker). However, several pieces of shorter tubing should \nnot be connected with fittings for the purpose of using \nup leftover lengths of tubing.\nNOTE: It is the responsibility of the installer to \nensure that further construction, finishing and other \nmechanical system installations do not compromise \nthe ManaBloc plumbing system as installed according \nto these instructions.\n1.    Tubing coils are usually placed at the ManaBloc \nlocation and tubing is pulled to the fixture through \nstud cavities, holes drilled overhead in floor joists, \netc. Several tubes may be pulled at one time. Viega’s \ncolor-coded ViegaPEX Ultra tubing helps prevent \ncross-connections.\n2.    Do not pull tubing tightly. Some slack (7\" per 50 \nfeet) is necessary to accommodate expansion and \ncontraction. Leave enough excess tubing at the \nbeginning and end of runs to make connections \nwithout putting strain on the tubing.\n3.    Exercise care when pulling PEX tubing to prevent \ncutting or abrading. Take care to prevent kinking of \nthe coiled tubing. If kinking or cutting occurs, cut \nout the damaged section and install a coupling.\n4.    For the best results, connect the distribution \nlines to fixtures and the ManaBloc immediately \nupon installation. Label the end-use fixture on the \nManaBloc cover plate next to the port.\n5.    Since plumbing fixtures are generally located in \ngroups, and there may be several ViegaPEX Ultra \ndistribution lines running to approximately the same \nlocation, it is easiest to run these distribution lines \nbundled together.\n    For a neat appearance, tie bundles with nylon ties \n(part number 43714 or 43701 or plastic strapping at \nregular intervals).\nNOTE: Bundles shall be sufficiently tied for tubing \nsupport but shall NOT restrict tubing expansion \nand contraction caused by temperature variations.\nCAUTION: DO NOT USE DUCT TAPE \nFOR BUNDLING. Duct tape will not permit \ntubing movement.\n6. Bundles can be supported with hangers \ndesigned for larger tubing sizes. \n7.    The nylon ties can be used \nto support PEX lines directly \nfrom wooden framing \nmembers. \nAny plastic cable ties capable \nof supporting the weight of \nthe tube or bundle when filled \nwith water can be used.\n8.    Holes drilled through studs, \njoists, plates, headers, etc., \nmust be large enough to \naccommodate tubing bundles \nwithout binding to allow free \nmovement. Several smaller \nholes (accommodating a few \nlines each) may be preferable \nto drilling a bundle-size hole. \nIn no case should the hole size \nexceed building code guidelines, \nas this could weaken the structural \nsupport members.\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to Section 16 of \nthis guide.\n\n39\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n15.2 Valve operation\nA ManaBloc system, which has valves on all of the \noutlet ports, does not require stop valves at the \nfixtures. However, the Authority Having Jurisdiction \n(AHJ) may require stop valves at some fixtures. \nUse the included red key handle to turn each \nport ON or OFF.

While holding the tube securely to prevent turning, \nfinish tightening the nut with the ManaBloc Wrench \n(part number 50631) until the white Lock-In insert \nappears between the lugs and becomes flush with \nthe ends of the lugs, plus ¼- to ½-turn.\nComplete the connection as soon as each distribution \nline is connected to the ManaBloc. Each valve should \nbe turned counter clockwise ¼-turn to the open \nposition after completing each connection, as \nshown above.\nWARNING: DO NOT use slip-joint pliers to \ntighten the Lock-In nuts. Use the ManaBloc \nwrench (part number 50631) to tighten the \ncompression connections.\n4. After all connections are complete, recheck that all \nof the Lock-In inserts are visible between the lugs \nand are flush or protruding slightly beyond the lugs.\n5. As the distribution lines are connected to the \nManaBloc, they should immediately be labeled on \nthe cover plate as to which fixture that line supplies. \nFixture labels are included with each ManaBloc. Affix \nthe appropriate label to the cover plate next to the port.\nCOMPRESSION CONNECTION CAUTION\nThis plumbing system relies upon the \nproper tightening of distribution line \ncompression connections.\nFailure to properly complete ALL connections may \nresult in system failure. Incomplete or improper \nconnections can hold pressure during a system test \nbut may fail at a later date, resulting in water damage.\nDO NOT OVERTIGHTEN compression fittings. \nOvertightening of the Lock-In compression nuts may \ncause damage to the tubing, nut, valve or fitting \nbody. DO NOT tighten Lock-In nuts beyond the \nrecommendation of these instructions (Step 3).\nLUG\nFor compression connections:\nNOT FOR USE WITH FOSTAPEX\nNOTE: The red ManaBloc valves designate hot \nports and the blue valves designate cold ports. \nMake sure the distribution lines are connected to the \ncorrect ports (hot or cold). The use of color-coded \nViegaPEX Ultra tubing reduces the possibility of cross \nconnections.\n1. For each distribution line, slide the Lock-In \ncompression nut (A), Lock-In insert (B) and the \nplastic ferrule (C) onto the tubing in that order. (See \nillustration below.)\nThe long taper of a ⅜\" ferrule (C) must be TOWARD \nTHE END OF THE TUBE; a ½\" ferrule is symmetrical \nand may be installed facing either direction. Insert the \nstainless steel stiffener (D) COMPLETELY into the \nend of the tubing.\nWARNING: DO NOT attempt to install the \nLock-In insert backward as it may break. \nALWAYS insert the long portion of the insert \nsleeve over the tube first.\nDO NOT attempt to use or reuse inserts that are \ndefective, cracked, broken or otherwise damaged, as \nconnection failure will result.\n2. Push the tubing into the port socket (E) until it \nbottoms out.\n     Holding the tube so that it does not back out of \nthe port socket, slide the white Lock-In insert \n \nand ferrule snugly against the chamber inside  \nthe port socket. \nWhile holding the tube against the bottom of the \nsocket, thread the Lock-In compression nut onto the \nport and tighten hand-tight.\nEDCBA\nE\n\n43\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n15.4 Connecting distribution lines to fixtures\nThere are a variety of male and female adapters, \nsweat adapters, turn out supports and stub out \nadapters to assist in terminating at the fixture. Refer \nto Section 18.1 though 18.4 of this guide or the Viega \nproduct catalog.\n15.5 Water supply connections\nThe main water supply shall be turned off before \nmaking water supply connections.\nThe ManaBloc water supply connection uses a special \n1\" swivel ManaBloc transition fitting that seals with a \nsealing element.\nManaBloc \nSupply Adapter \n(PEX Press shown)\nThis connection is used on the cold water supply and \nthe hot water supply/return lines. This connection to \nthe ManaBloc does not require any form of thread \nsealant and none shall be used. \nDO NOT USE ANY FORM OF THREAD \nSEALANT TO MAKE THIS CONNECTION.\nNOTE: Water service connections to adapt to most \ntypes of plumbing supply materials are available. \nConsult the Viega Product Catalog for a complete \nlisting of available connections.\n1. Connect water service adapters to water supply \npiping before attaching the swivel fitting to the \nManaBloc (instructions included with adapters). \nExcessive force from threaded fittings or solvents \nfrom solvent welding (PVC or CPVC) will cause \ndamage to the ManaBloc. Drill all holes in wood \nmembers for water supply/return tubing BEFORE \nmounting the ManaBloc.\n   2. When using male or female pipe thread transition \nfittings, to connect to supply tubing, use only \nTeflon\n®\n tape to seal pipe threads. DO NOT use pipe \ndopes, thread sealers, Teflon\n®\n pastes, etc.\n3. If copper sweat fittings are used anywhere in the \nManaBloc water supply line or water heater supply/\nreturn lines, these fittings must be soldered, cooled \nand flushed of any flux residue before these lines \nare connected to the ManaBloc. \nSoldering creates a tremendous amount of heat, \nwhich could melt the ManaBloc, and solder flux \ncontains strong acids and may also contain \npetroleum products. \nThese compounds can attack the plastic materials \nfrom which the ManaBloc is made and cause \ncrazing, cracking and failure of the ManaBloc, \nresulting in leaks and water damage.\n4. Ensure that the hot/cold supply lines are connected \nto the correct supply inlet/outlet on the ManaBloc. \nRed valves designate hot ports; blue valves \ndesignate cold ports.\n5. Supply lines shall enter and/or exit the ManaBloc \nin a straight line. If bending of the supply lines \nis required, the tubing must be anchored to a \nframing member to isolate the bend stress from \nthe ManaBloc or use a directional fitting.\n6. After the supply tubing has been connected to the \ntransition fitting, remove the plastic protective cap \nfrom the ManaBloc inlet/outlet part and thread the \nswivel nut onto the threaded male adapter hand- \ntight only. DO NOT CROSS-THREAD.\nDO NOT ELECTRICALLY GROUND  \nTO THIS SYSTEM.\nSwivel fittings must be ALIGNED CORRECTLY \nbefore being attached to the ManaBloc. The piping \nmaterial must not be allowed to put stress on the \nManaBloc, as leaking and damage may result.\nHAND-TIGHTEN ONLY\nHAND-TIGHTEN ONLY\nMANABLOC\n®\nDamage \nmay result if \novertightened\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n44\n16.1 Handling ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\nThe properties of ViegaPEX Ultra tubing make it easy \nto work with and install in most types of construction. \nSome care must be taken to prevent damage to the \ntubing before and during installation:\n• Use care to protect both ViegaPEX Ultra and \nFostaPEX tubing from physical damage during \nstorage and installation. Keep the tubing away from \nsharp objects, open flames, etc., and do not place \nheavy objects on the tubing. \n• Damaged sections of tubing should be cut out \n   and discarded.\n• Do not expose ViegaPEX Ultra tubing to \nsunlight or any UV source for extended \nperiods of time exceeding six months. \n• FostaPEX, with its aluminum layer, is resistant to UV \nlight, but long-term exposure should still be avoided.\n• Do not store ViegaPEX Ultra or FostaPEX tubing \noutdoors where it may be exposed to UV light.\n16.2 Uncoiling ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\nAn uncoiler should be used to prevent twisting when \nremoving tubing from ⅜\" to 1\" coils. Roll coils out and \nuse care to avoid twisting 1¼\", 1½\" and 2\" coils or \nwhen an uncoiler is unavailable. \n16.3 Bending ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\nViegaPEX Ultra tubing can be free bent (unsupported \nbend) to a minimum radius of eight times the tubing \nO.D. and five times the tubing O.D. with the use of \na Viega-approved bend support. FostaPEX tubing \ncan be free bent to a minimum radius of eight times \nthe tubing O.D. and 3.5 times the tubing O.D. with the \nuse of a Viega tubing bender. For situations requiring \ntighter bends, use elbow fittings. If bending against \na PEX coil bend direction, the bending radius is 24 \ntimes the tubing O.D. Viega does not allow the practice \nof “hot bending” ViegaPEX Ultra tubing to make a \ntighter bend radius.\nTubing sizeMaximum distance from fitting to bend\n⅜\" PEXL = 6 inches\n½\" PEXL = 8 inches\n¾\" PEXL = 10 inches\n1\" PEXL = 12 inches\n1¼\" PEXL = 14 inches\n1½\" PEXL = 16 inches\n2\" PEX   L = 18 inches\nL\nUsing a tubing fastener \nnear a connection \nto support bend and \nreduce stress on fitting\nL\nUsing a bend support \nnear a Viega PEX \nconnection to reduce \nstress on fitting\nOD\nBend\nRadius\nR\nMinimum bending radius \nfor ViegaPEX Ultra \ntubing\nTo reduce damaging stress on Viega PEX fittings, \nbend supports or tubing fasteners must be used \nto anchor all bends made close to fittings. Support \nmust be provided for tubing bends located closer \nto fittings than distance “L” in table below. (See the \ndiagrams below for typical installation examples.) Since \nFostaPEX will maintain its shape once bent, supports \nmay not be necessary. However, support must be used \nat the “L” distance while making the bend.\n16 Installing the ViegaPEX Ultra Tubing System\nViegaPEX UltraMinimum Radius\nNominal Size*\nFree Bend \n(8 x O.D.)\nSupported \n(5 x O.D.)\n⅜\"4\"2.5\"\n½\"5\"3.1\"\n¾\"7\"4.4\"\n1\"9\"5.6\"\n1¼\"11\"6.75\"\n1½\"13\"8.1\"\n2\"17\"10.6\"\n*ViegaPEX Ultra bend radius values were calculated \nusing standard CTS O.D. dimensions, which are ⅛\" larger \nthan the nominal tube size listed.\nFostaPEXMinimum Radius\nNominal Size**\nFree Bend \n(8 x O.D.)\nSupported \n(3.5 x O.D.)\n½\"5.6\"2.4\"\n¾\"7.5\"3.3\"\n1\"9.6\"4.2\"\n** FostaPEX bend radius values were calculated using \nthe actual O.D. dimensions, which include the additional \naluminum and PE layers. \n\n45\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n16.4 Removing Viega PEX connections\nShould a mistake be made, simply cut out the PEX \nfitting and replace with a new one. \nDo not reuse Viega PEX fittings \nInserting a coupling to repair kinked tubing\n15.5 Repairs\nSections of kinked tubing should be repaired by \ncutting out the damaged section and installing a \nrepair coupling. \nPEX tubing systems \nshould not be \nintentionally subjected \nto freezing.\nDo not use open torch \nor excessive heat to \nthaw PEX tubing. Tubing \nfailure or damage can result.\nHeat (DO NOT USE A TORCH) must be applied \ndirectly to the frozen tubing section. Temperature \non tubing shall not exceed 180°F.\nSeveral suitable methods exist to thaw PEX \ntubing:\n  • Hot water\n  • Wet, hot towels\n  • Hand-held hair dryer\n  • Low-wattage electrical heating tape (self limiting)\n• A commercial system that pumps heated water \nthrough a tube to the ice blockage and returns \nthe cooled water for reheating\n16.7 Water heaters\nViegaPEX Ultra tubing should not be connected directly \nto gas-fired water heaters. The high temperatures of \nthese appliances can damage the tubing. \nWhen connecting a Viega PEX system to a gas-fired \nwater heater, install a minimum of 18\" of metallic piping \nbetween the water heater and tubing, keeping tubing \nmore than 6\" away from the vent pipe. Where local \ncode allows, ViegaPEX Ultra tubing may be connected \ndirectly to electric water heaters and used for hot water \nrecirculation lines that do not come within 6\" of the gas \nheater vent.\n16.6 Freezing\nThe flexibility of ViegaPEX Ultra tubing makes it \nresistant to damage from freezing, but precautions \nto prevent freezing should be taken when low \ntemperatures might be encountered.\nInsulating each PEX tube individually or as a group is \nnot generally necessary if the PEX tubing is installed \nwithin the insulation envelope of the structure, i.e. the \nheated area. For example, the tubing may be installed \nunder the insulation in the attic or within an interior wall \nof a heated space.\nA minimum of 18\" of metallic piping is required \nbetween a gas-fired water heater and PEX tubing.\nViegaPEX Ultra may be used to connect to \ninstantaneous/tankless water heaters or other \nhot-water-producing devices. However, consult \nmanufacturer’s recommendations for use with plastic \ntubing and ensure temperature and pressure do not \nexceed the maximum ratings of the tubing.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n46\nMaintain a minimum 12\" of vertical and 6\" of \nhorizontal clearance from recessed lights and \nappliance or heater vents.\n6\" minimum\n12\" minimum\n16.8 Heaters, flues, vents and recessed lights\nKeep ViegaPEX Ultra tubing a MINIMUM of 12\" \nvertically and 6\" horizontally from sources of high \nheat such as gas flue vents, heating appliances or \nelectric motors. Concerning recessed lighting (including \nlow-voltage types) and proper installation clearance, \nViega recognizes the following types of lighting fixtures: \nType IC or Inherently Protected, which allow direct \ncontact with thermal insulation and other combustible \nmaterials, and Type Non-IC, which require a minimum \nclearance of 3\" to thermal insulation. If room does not \nallow for the minimum clearance spacing specified by \nViega, then the PEX tubing must be insulated with a \nsuitable pipe insulation capable of withstanding the \nspecific maximum temperatures generated by the \nfixture. Minimum clearance between any pipe insulation \nand fixture shall be per the requirements of the fixture \ntype and local building codes. \nForced air heating ducts and PVC power vent flues \nare not generally considered sources of high heat. \nThese areas of installation should be rechecked after \nfurther construction and other mechanical systems \nhave been installed.\nIn cases where light leakage (direct beam) from a \nUV-generating light source (special lighting or heating- \ntype lamps) is possible, tubing must be adequately \nprotected with light-blocking insulation.\n\n47\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n17 Fastening the Viega PEX System\n Nailing plates protect tubing passing \nthrough studs and joists from nails.\nSuspension clip fasteners used to protect tubing from \nabrasion when passing through steel studs\n17.1 Wood frame construction\nViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX tubing are ideal for use \nin wood frame construction. The ability to bend the \ntubing around corners and obstacles greatly simplifies \ninstallation. This system eliminates the expensive and \ntime-consuming use of fittings where tubing turns \nwithin a wall, and it eliminates the potential fire hazard \nof soldering close to exposed framing members.\nA few rules should be followed when running  \nViegaPEX Ultra tubing in wood frame construction:\n• Use nailing plates to protect the tubing from nails and \nscrews where it passes through studs\n• Suspension clips are required for metal studs and \noptional for wooden studs\n• When turning tubing sharply to exit from a wall, a \nbend support must be provided. Either use a drop-\near bend support, drop-ear elbow or a stub out. \nNeglecting to use a support will place excessive \nstress on the fitting, and the tubing will not exit \nperpendicular to the wall (except FostaPEX).\n17.2 Steel construction\nThe Viega PEX system works as well in steel frame \nconstruction as it does in wood. Where tubing runs \nthrough metal studs, suspension clip fasteners must \nbe used to protect tubing from sharp stud edges. \n(See illustration below.) Follow the same guidelines for \nfastening and supporting the tubing as for wood frame \nconstruction.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n48\n17.3 Supporting ViegaPEX Ultra tubing\nUse only plastic or plastic-coated tubing supports. \nMetal supports may damage tubing.\nWhen running tubing, leave a small amount of slack \nbetween fasteners to account for tubing contraction.\nNote that ViegaPEX Ultra tubing will expand or contract \n1.1\" per 100' for every 10°F of temperature change. \nIn long straight runs, allow adequate clearance for \nthis. (See “17.9 Tubing expansion” on Page 49.) The \naluminum layer in FostaPEX reduces expansion and \ncontraction, so that it expands only 0.16\" per 100' for \nevery 10°F of temperature change. This makes it ideal \nfor locations where expansion must be minimized.\nTubing should be allowed freedom to move slightly \nas it expands. Do not clip it tightly into place or locate \nit where it will be tightly constrained. Use suspension \nclips or an approved plastic insulator where tubing \npasses through studs or joists where abrasion and \nnoise is a concern. (See illustrations to right.)\nViegaPEX Ultra tubing must be fastened at a minimum \ninterval noted in the table below for vertical and \nhorizontal support.\nSuspension clips support tubing in joist penetrations \nor anywhere abrasion is a concern.\nIn risers or vertical runs, ViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX \ntubing should be attached with suspension clips or \nan approved plastic insulator at each floor or ceiling \npenetration, and every four feet in between (see below).\nTubing supported with U-clip or lock clip fasteners on \nhorizontal runs\nSuspension clip fasteners used at floor plate\nJ-clamp or lock clip fasteners used to support tubing \nin vertical runs between floors\nMidlevel \nGuide\nSpacing per \nTable 17.1\nSome model codes may allow greater \nsupport spacing intervals for plastic tubing. \nAlways refer to local code for approved \nspacing requirements that exceed the ones \nreferenced in this manual.\nTable 17.1 PEX Support\nPEX SizeHorizontalVertical\nViegaPEX \nUltra\n½\" - 1\"32\" O.C.Base of \neach floor \nwith midlevel \nguide\n1¼\" - 2\"48\" O.C.\nFostaPEX½\" - 1\"32\" O.C.\n\n49\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n17.4 Noise and water hammer in PEX systems\nAs with all plumbing materials under some \noperating conditions, water hammer can occur in \nPEX plumbing systems. The inherent flexibility of \nViegaPEX Ultra drastically reduces the magnitude of \npressure surges compared with metallic plumbing \nmaterials. Damage to plumbing components in a \nPEX system due to these pressure surges is highly \nunlikely, although noise can sometimes result. \nFortunately, there are solutions to minimize or \neliminate water hammer noise.\n• Install fixtures that are not water hammer prone. \n   As a general rule, two-handle fixtures are less likely \nto cause hammer than single-handle fixtures. Single-\nhandle shower valves, which rotate to close and \ntherefore are difficult to close quickly, might be \n   good choices.\n• Clamping or strapping more frequently may help \nprevent tubing noise. It is important that the tubing \nnot be in contact with wallboard, forced air ducts \n \nor other high-resonance articles. Insufficiently  \nor improperly clamped or strapped tubing may \nmove during fixture operation and hit against  \nthese surfaces.\n• Install a water hammer arrester at fixtures where \nnoise is a problem. A water hammer arrester (AA \nsized) installed as closely as possible to the fixture \non the cold-water side only will eliminate the source \nof the noise (the pressure wave). It should be noted \nthat even with an arrester, tubing that is clamped or \nstrapped insufficiently may still hit against something \nas it moves slightly when the water flow is stopped. \n• Avoid operating fixtures in such a way that causes \nnear instantaneous shutoff. Simply closing fixtures in \na less abrupt manner can eliminate hammer noise.\n17.5 Shower valves\nPEX lines should only be run to the inlet connections of \ntub/shower valves unless specifically approved by the \nvalve manufacturer for other connections. \n17.6 Electrical grounding\nNeither ViegaPEX Ultra nor FostaPEX tubing may be \nused as an electrical ground. Consult the NEC for \nrecommended grounding method when plastic pipe \nis used.\n17.7 Expanding foams \nWhen penetrations must be sealed for air infiltration \npurposes, there are several options available. Use a \ngood grade of silicone, acrylic or siliconized acrylic \ncaulking. DO NOT use oil-based caulks. Most \ncanned expanding foams and open- or closed-cell pipe \ninsulation are good sealing materials and may be used \nin direct contact with PEX tubing. Other materials may \nbe used provided they do not cause short- or long-term \ndamage to the PEX tubing.\n17.8 Fire Stop compounds \nMost building codes require the use of a fire-\nstopping compound when tubing penetrates a \nfire-rated wall. There are a number of fire-stopping \ncompounds identified as water based, acrylic or \nlatex that have been listed for use with PEX tubing \nthat include but are not limited to the following.\n•   3M Fire Protection — CP 25WB+ Caulk\n•   Tremco, Inc — TREMstop® IA\n•   Specified Technologies, Inc. — SpecSeal® \nSSS 100 / SSS 102\n• Passive Fire Protection Partners — Fire Stop\n™\n \n4800 DW / 4100 DW / 4100 NS / 3600 EX\nIt is the responsibility of the user to determine \nthe suitability of these or any products for the \nintended application and install the compounds \nin accordance with the product’s installation \ninstructions and listing.\n17.9 Tubing expansion\nViegaPEX Ultra tubing, as with any PEX tubing, \nexpands and contracts with temperature changes \nin the environment or the fluid inside the tubing. \nThe longer the tubing run and the higher the \ntemperature change, the more linear expansion \nthe system will experience. This expansion and \ncontraction can affect the appearance as well as \nintegrity of the system by putting stress on the \ntubing, fittings, valves and fasteners. \nWhen using expanding spray foam to insulate \nwalls in a structure, there are several options \navailable. Viega suggests using water-based or \nurethane-based open-cell insulation only. DO NOT use \nclosed-cell spray foams. Closed-cell spray foams have \nthe potential to generate high temperatures during their \nexpansion process, especially when not applied \nproperly, which can damage PEX tubing. Always follow \nthe spray foam manufacturer’s installation instructions \nand warnings.\nDo not expose Viega products to any \nforeign substance that includes but is \nnot limited to Volatile Organic Chemical \n(VOC) compounds, paints, solvents, \nglues, cleaners and disinfectants. Viega \nproducts that are exposed to these \ntypes of substances are at risk of having \nfailures (leaks).\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n50\nUsing a loop to accommodate \ntubing expansion\nOffsets also provide room for \ntubing expansion.\nAllow some slack in all runs to prevent \ndamage from tubing contraction.\nBelow is an example of required offsets for a 100-foot \ntubing run. Note that the expansion compensators are \nno more than 50 feet apart.\n100'\n25'25'50'\n50'50'\n∆L = \nPEX expansion rate\n100' x 10°F\nx ∆T x LT\nWhere:\nViegaPEX Ultra expansion rate = 1.1\" per 100' per \n10°F\n∆T = Change in temperature (in °F)\nLT = Length of tube between fixed points (in ft.)\n∆L = \n1.1\"\n1000\nx 60° x 40' = 2.64\"\n∆L = 2.64\"\nFor example:\n40' of 1\" ViegaPEX Ultra tubing going from 70°F to \n130°F\n17.9.1 Calculating expansion loops and offsets\nThere are three types of expansion offsets \nrecommended for use with large-diameter tubing: \nthe corner expansion offset, the Z-type expansion \noffset and the U-type expansion loop. A description, \nillustration and dimensions chart for each type of \noffset is on the next few pages. See “FostaPEX” on \nPage 54 for FostaPEX recommendations.\nLinear expansion:\n To calculate linear expansion for PEX tubing, use \nthe following formula:\nTubing fasteners perform two functions: providing \nsupport for the tubing and guiding the tubing during \nexpansion and contraction. It is important to keep \nthis in mind when installing fasteners. An expansion \ncompensator will not be effective if the fasteners \nprevent linear movement of the piping system.\nTubing sizes smaller than ¾\" generally do not \nrequire expansion compensators with fittings and \ncan easily be bent into loops and offsets to absorb \nlinear expansion. Tubing sizes 1\" and larger, refer \nto “17.9.1 Calculating expansion loops and offsets” \nfor compensation options.\nFor unconstrained tubing runs (not within the floor) \nViega recommends the use of expansion offsets. \nThis can be accomplished at a corner or by using \noffsets or loops on straight tubing runs.

The circulating system keeps \nhot water readily available throughout the main hot \nwater supply line, eliminating the need to purge the \nentire line before hot water is present at the fixture. \nThere are a number of hot water circulation systems \navailable in the marketplace that offer a variety of \noptions. These systems are ideal for branch-and-\nmain or combination systems with spread-out fixture \ngroups/\nfloor plans, as well as for larger homes using \nmultiple ManaBlocs in a parallel-type system.\nViegaPEX Ultra can be used in recirculating domestic \nhot water plumbing loops, provided: \n1. The plumbing loops shall operate with water \ntemperatures of 140°F or lower, as required by most \nmodel plumbing codes.\n2. The recirculating loop is for supplying hot water more \nquickly to the fixture.\n3.

These supports allow \nthe tubing to make the tight bend necessary to exit \nthe wall at a 90° angle as well as providing a flange for \nsecuring the support. \nThe exposed tubing can then be connected to a valve, \nusing an optional chrome sleeve to cover the tubing if \ndesired.\n18.1 Stub out options\nThe Viega PEX system includes fittings to \naccommodate most plumbing needs.

Copper tubing \nadapters slip over copper tubing to provide a sweat \nconnection. Always make the sweat connection to the \nfitting before connecting PEX to avoid heat damage to \nthe tubing. \nCopper fitting adapters fit into copper fittings to \nmate PEX to standard sweat or ProPress fittings. As \nwith copper tubing adapters, always make sweat \nconnections prior to PEX connection to avoid tubing \ndamage.\nPEX Crimp fitting adapters are not for use \nwith the Viega ProPress connection.\n18.2.1 Soldering Zero Lead alloy PEX fittings\nViega’s Zero Lead PEX fittings are manufactured \nfrom alloys known for their low lead content and \ncorrosion-resistant properties. These alloys have \nlower thermal conductivity compared to standard \n(leaded) alloys, which tends to make them more \nsensitive to soldering conditions. It is important to \nfollow the steps below to ensure consistent leak-\nfree solder connections. \nPrepping and cleaning\nZero Lead alloys are harder than standard alloys. \nCleaning and prepping the Zero Lead solder joint \narea with an abrasive product like emery cloth, \nsandpaper or wire brush is an important step in \nthe solder process. Do not rely on flux alone. This \nsurface preparation removes the natural oxidative \nbarrier that tends to form on Zero Lead alloys. \nOnce this is done, fluxing and soldering should be \ndone immediately to ensure the oxide film does not \nreform on the freshly cleaned surface.\nUse of proper flux and solder\nOnly use flux containing chloride compounds. \nSolder fluxes without chloride compounds are  \nnot recommended for use on Zero Lead alloys. \nOnly lead-free solder should be used to \nmake Zero Lead solder connections.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n58\nMale Adapters\nFemale Adapters\nNPT Elbows Adapters\n18.3 Threaded connections\nThe Viega PEX system also provides a number of \nfittings to adapt ViegaPEX Ultra and FostaPEX tubing \nto NPT threads. \nIn addition to the NPT drop-ear elbows already \nmentioned, metallic male and female adapters and \nmale NPT elbows provide threaded connections.\nThe threaded connection should always be made \nbefore the PEX connection to avoid twisting the \nPEX connection.\nDo not use metallic threaded adapters when \nconnecting to polymer threads.\nHeating\nLike standard (leaded) alloys, heating of the \nZero Lead solder joint should be done evenly \nand gradually using an appropriately sized tip \nwith constant movement of the flame over the \njoint. Be careful not to overheat the Zero Lead \nalloy while making a solder joint. Overheating \nwill result in a brown discoloration of the metal, \nwhich is an indication that flux has burned out of \nthe solder joint, potentially causing incomplete \nsolder coverage. If you suspect this has occurred, \ndisassemble the joint, clean and repeat the process \nusing proper heating techniques.\nProper Cool Down\nBecause Zero Lead alloys have a lower thermal \nconductivity than standard alloys they do not \ncool down as quickly after making a solder \nconnection. If excessive heating has occurred and \nan accelerated cooling process is required, apply \na damp cloth to the freshly completed solder joint. \nThis will help minimize the risk of the solder joint \nmoving or leaking solder out of the joint before the \njoint can cool.\n\n59\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n18.4 Valves\nIn-line ball valves are available for use with ViegaPEX \nUltra tubing.

If potable water \nis not available, or the potential for a freezing \ncondition exists, pneumatic* (air or nitrogen) testing \nand/or the use of an RV antifreeze** solution are \nalso acceptable methods for pressure testing.\n*  Use air testing only if approved by local code or \nthe Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)!\n**  RV antifreeze shall be drained and flushed from \nall portions of the plumbing system prior to \nconsumer use.\nAlways refer to local plumbing code for pressure \ntesting requirements and approved methods \nspecific to plastic plumbing systems. If none \nis specified, refer to Table 19.1 for acceptable \nmethods, test pressures and durations.\nNOTICE - ManaBloc VALVE INFORMATION!\nOpening a port valve to an empty or \nunpressurized distribution line may cause \nvalve damage. \nTo prevent potential valve damage or failure, open the \nport valves before filling and pressurizing the lines. The \nforce of water rushing to fill an empty line can cause \nthe valve’s seal to “clip off,” resulting in incomplete \nsealing or complete valve failure.\nCARE must be exercised when opening a port valve to \nan empty or unpressurized line. The fixture to which the \nline is connected should be in the OFF position and the \nvalve must be opened slowly until water starts to flow \ninto the line.\nDO NOT CONTINUE to open the valve until the line is \nfull and pressurized. Open the valve fully only after the \nline is up to system pressure. The fixture can then be \nopened to purge the line of air. \nValve stems are replaceable. Order part number 51602.\nWATER TESTING SHALL BE AVOIDED \nDURING FREEZING CONDITIONS. UNDER NO \nCIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE SYSTEM BE \nTESTED AT TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN \n10 ̊F (-12 ̊C). \nFOLLOW ANTIFREEZE MANUFACTURER’S \nINSTRUCTIONS FOR CONCENTRATIONS.  \nUse only nontoxic antifreeze approved for \ndrinking water systems.\nNOTE: If such a solution is used, the antifreeze solution \nmust be sufficiently concentrated to withstand the \nlowest temperature encountered while the testing fluid \nis in the system. Antifreeze solutions should be purged \nand the system flushed with potable water prior to \nconsumer use. \nWARNING! PRESSURES USED IN  \nTESTING CAN BLOW UNMADE OR \nINCOMPLETE CONNECTIONS APART  \nWITH TREMENDOUS FORCE! \nThis force is many times greater when air is used as \na test medium. To reduce the risk of personal injury, \nensure that all connections are completed before \ntesting. Use only the pressure and time required to \ndetermine that the system is leak free.\n\nIM-PF 724596 0417\n62\n•   If pressure falls over the test period, look for \npotential leaks with an approved leak-detect \nsolution.

The following sections \nprovide information to help select the best system \nbased on the application.\n3.1 Home run systems\nThe Viega ManaBloc manifold system, also known \nas a parallel or home run system, is a unique \nmethod of plumbing that provides homeowners \nwater and energy savings and can reduce water \nwaste by up to 40% compared to traditional \nsystems.\nCombination Installation\nHome Run Installation\nConnectionsLow\nInstallation TimeMedium\nSystem EfficiencyHigh\nFeatures that the Viega ManaBloc system offers its \ncustomers over branch and tee plumbing systems \ninclude:\n•   Faster Hot Water Delivery – properly sized \nlines deliver hot water up to four times faster\n•   Dedicated lines to each fixture use fewer \nfitting connections behind walls\n•   Balanced Water Delivery – multiple fixtures \ncan be used simultaneously without \nnoticeable pressure or temperature changes\n•   Better Control of the Plumbing System – \nindividual ¼-turn shutoff valves provide a \nsimple way of servicing a fixture or adding on \nto the system\n3.2 Combination systems\nA combination system uses multiple manifolds \ncombined with a branch-and-tee supply system. \nThese systems use small manifolds located \nthroughout a structure placed near each main \nfixture group and are supplied by the main hot \nand cold supply lines similar to the branch-and-\ntee system. The manifolds branch multiple lines \nfrom a common location in lieu of multiple tee \nfittings spread throughout. This takes advantage \nof benefits from both types of systems and helps \nkeep hidden fittings to a minimum.\n•   Ideal for areas with multiple fixtures grouped \ntogether\n•   Uses fewer connections behind walls \ncompared to branch and tee\nConnectionsMedium\nInstallation TimeLow\nSystem EfficiencyMedium",
